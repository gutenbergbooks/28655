<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>NO.&nbsp;999</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;All aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph Fairbanks swung into the cab of No.&nbsp;999
with the lever hooked up for forward motion,
and placed a firm hand on the throttle.</p>
<p>It looked as though half the working force of
the railroad, and every juvenile friend he had
ever known in Stanley Junction, had come down
to the little old depot that beautiful summer afternoon
to especially celebrate the greatest event in
his active railroad career.</p>
<p>Ralph was the youngest engineer in the service
of the Great Northern, and there was full reason
why he should center attention and interest on
this the proudest moment of his life. No.&nbsp;999
was the crack locomotive of the system, brand
new and resplendent. Its headlight was a great
glow of crystal, its metal bands and trimmings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
shone like burnished gold, and its cab was as
spick and span and neat as the private office of
the division superintendent himself.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;999 was out for a trial run&mdash;a record run,
Ralph hoped to make it. One particular car
attached to the rear of the long train was the
main object of interest. It was a new car to the
road, and its blazoned name suggested an importance
out of the ordinary&mdash;&#8220;China &amp; Japan
Mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>This car had just come in over a branch section
by a short cut from the north. If No.&nbsp;999
could beat timetable routine half an hour and
deliver the mail to the Overland Express at
Bridgeport, two hundred miles distant, on time,
it would create a new schedule, and meant a good
contract for the Great Northern, besides a saving
of three hours&#8217; time over the former roundabout
trip of the China &amp; Japan Mail.</p>
<p>Ralph had exchanged jolly greetings with his
friends up to now. In an instant, however, the
sonorous, echoing &#8220;All aboard&#8221; from the conductor
way down the train was a signal for duty,
prompt and imperative. The pleasant depot
scene faded from the sight and mind of the ambitious
young railroader. He turned his strict
attention now to the cab interior, as though the
locomotive was a thing of life and intelligence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;er go, Ralph!&#8221;</p>
<p>John Griscom, the oldest engineer on the road,
off duty, but a privileged character on all occasions,
stepped from the gossiping crowd of
loungers at a little distance. He swung up into
the cab with the expert airiness of long usage.
His bluff, hearty face expressed admiration and
satisfaction, as his rapid eye took in the cab
layout.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hold up the tender rail till we get to
crossing,&#8221; announced Griscom. &#8220;Lad, this is
front rank service all right, and I&#8217;m happy to
say that you deserve it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Griscom,&#8221; answered Ralph,
his face beaming at the handsome compliment.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t forget, though, that you helped some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, so, so,&#8221; declared Griscom. &#8220;I say, Fogg,
you&#8217;re named right.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was to Lemuel Fogg that Griscom spoke.
Fogg was Ralph&#8217;s fireman on the present trip.
He presented a decided contrast to the brisk,
bright engineer of No.&nbsp;999. He shoveled in the
coal with a grim mutter, and slammed the fire
door shut with a vicious and unnecessary bang.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you getting at?&#8221; he growled, with a
surly eye on Griscom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fogg&mdash;fog, see? foggy, that&#8217;s you&mdash;and
groggy, eh? Sun&#8217;s shining&mdash;why don&#8217;t you take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
it in? No slouch privilege firing this magnificent
king of the road, I&#8217;m thinking, and you ought
to think so, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; snapped Fogg, &#8220;it&#8217;ll be kid luck, if we
get through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oho! there&#8217;s where the shoe pinches, is it?&#8221;
bantered the old railroad veteran. &#8220;Come, be
fair, Fogg. You was glad to win your own spurs
when you were young.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, mind the try-out, you hear me!&#8221;
snorted Fogg ungraciously. &#8220;You mind your
own business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; shot out Griscom quickly, as he caught
a whiff from Fogg&#8217;s lips, &#8220;you be sure you mind
yours&mdash;and the rules,&#8221; he added, quite sternly,
&#8220;I advise you not to get too near the furnace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your breath might catch fire, that&#8217;s why,&#8221;
announced Griscom bluntly, and turned his back
on the disgruntled fireman.</p>
<p>Ralph had not caught this sharp cross-fire of
repartee. His mind had been intently fixed on
his task. He had started up the locomotive
slowly, but now, clearing the depot switches, he
pulled the lever a notch or two, watching carefully
ahead. As the train rounded a curve to an
air line, a series of brave hurrahs along the side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
of the track sent a thrill of pleasure through
Ralph&#8217;s frame.</p>
<p>The young engineer had only a fleeting second
or two to bestow on a little group, standing at the
rear fence of a yard backing down to the tracks.
His mother was there, gaily waving a handkerchief.
A neighbor joined in the welcome, and
half-a-dozen boys and small children with whom
Ralph was a rare favorite made the air ring with
enthusiastic cheers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends everywhere, lad,&#8221; spoke Griscom in
a kindly tone, and then, edging nearer to his
prime young favorite, he half-whispered: &#8220;Keep
your eye on this grouch of a Fogg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you don&#8217;t mean anything serious, Mr.
Griscom?&#8221; inquired Ralph, with a quick glance
at the fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; proclaimed the old railroader
plainly. &#8220;He&#8217;s got it in for you&mdash;it&#8217;s the talk of
the yards, and he&#8217;s in just the right frame of mind
to bite off his own nose to spite his face. So
long.&#8221;</p>
<p>The locomotive had slowed up for crossing signals,
and Griscom got to the ground with a careless
sail through the air, waved his hand, and
Ralph buckled down to real work on No.&nbsp;999.</p>
<p>He glanced at the schedule sheet and the clock.
The gauges were in fine working order. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
was not a full head of steam on as yet and the fire
box was somewhat over full, but there was a
strong draft and a twenty-mile straight run before
them, and Ralph felt they could make it easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t choke her too full, Mr. Fogg,&#8221; he remarked
to the fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teach me!&#8221; snorted Fogg, and threw another
shovelful into the box already crowded, and
backed against the tender bar with a surly, defiant
face.</p>
<p>Ralph made no retort. Fogg did, indeed, know
his business, if he was only minded to attend to it.
He was somewhat set and old-fashioned in his
ways, and he had grown up in the service from
wiper.</p>
<p>Ralph recalled Griscom&#8217;s warning. It was not
pleasant to run two hundred miles with a grumpy
cab comrade. Ralph wished they had given him
some other helper. However, he reasoned that
even a crack fireman might be proud of a regular
run on No.&nbsp;999, and he did not believe that Fogg
would hurt his own chances by any tactics that
might delay them.</p>
<p>The landscape drifted by swiftly and more
swiftly, as Ralph gave the locomotive full head.
A rare enthusiasm and buoyancy came into the
situation. There was something fascinating in
the breathless rush, the superb power and steadiness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
of the crack machine, so easy of control
that she was a marvel of mechanical genius and
perfection.</p>
<p>Like a panorama the scenery flashed by, and
in rapid mental panorama Ralph reviewed the
glowing and stirring events of his young life,
which in a few brief months had carried him
from his menial task as an engine wiper up to the
present position which he cherished so proudly.</p>
<p>Ralph was a railroader by inheritance as well
as predilection. His father had been a pioneer
in the beginning of the Great Northern. After
he died, through the manipulations of an unworthy
village magnate named Gasper Farrington,
his widow and son found themselves at the
mercy of that heartless schemer, who held a
mortgage on their little home.</p>
<p>In the first volume of the present series, entitled
&#8220;Ralph of the Roundhouse,&#8221; it was told
how Ralph left school to earn a living and help
his self-sacrificing mother in her poverty.</p>
<p>Ralph got a job in the roundhouse, and held it,
too, despite the malicious efforts of Ike Slump, a
ne&#8217;er-do-well who tried to undermine him. Ralph
became a favorite with the master mechanic of
the road through some remarkable railroad service
in which he saved the railroad shops from
destruction by fire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>Step by step Ralph advanced, and the second
volume of this series, called &#8220;Ralph in the Switch
Tower,&#8221; showed how manly resolve, and being
right and doing right, enabled him to overcome
his enemies and compel old Farrington to release
the fraudulent mortgage. Incidentally, Ralph
made many friends. He assisted a poor waif
named Van Sherwin to reach a position of comfort
and honor, and was instrumental in aiding
a former business partner of his father, one Farwell
Gibson, to complete a short line railroad
through the woods near Dover.</p>
<p>In the third volume of the present series, entitled
&#8220;Ralph on the Engine,&#8221; was related how
our young railroad friend became an active employee
of the Great Northern as a fireman. He
made some record runs with old John Griscom,
the veteran of the road. In that volume was also
depicted the ambitious but blundering efforts of
Zeph Dallas, a farmer boy who was determined
to break into railroading, and there was told as
well the grand success of little Limpy Joe, a railroad
cripple, who ran a restaurant in an old, dismantled
box car.</p>
<p>These and other staunch, loyal friends had
rallied around Ralph with all the influence they
could exert, when after a creditable examination
Ralph was placed on the extra list as an engineer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>Van and Zeph had been among the first to
congratulate the friend to whom they owed so
much, when, after a few months&#8217; service on accomodation
runs, it was made known that Ralph
had been appointed as engineer of No.&nbsp;999.</p>
<p>It was Limpy Joe, spending a happy vacation
week with motherly, kind-hearted Mrs. Fairbanks,
who led the cheering coterie whom Ralph
had passed near his home as he left the Junction
on his present run.</p>
<p>Of his old-time enemies, Ike Slump and Mort
Bemis were in jail, the last Ralph had heard of
them. There was a gang in his home town, however,
whom Ralph had reason to fear. It was
made up of men who had tried to cripple the
Great Northern through an unjust strike. A man
named Jim Evans had been one of the leaders.
Fogg had sympathized with the strikers. Griscom
and Ralph had routed the malcontents in
a fair, open-handed battle of arguments and
blows. Fogg had been reinstated by the road, but
he had to go back on the promotion list, and his
rancor was intense when he learned that Ralph
had been chosen to a position superior to his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;They want young blood, the railroad nobs
tell it,&#8221; the disgruntled fireman had been heard
to remark in his favorite tippling place on Railroad
Street. &#8220;Humph! They&#8217;ll have blood, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
lots of it, if they trust the lives of passengers
and crew to a lot of kindergarten graduates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of all this Ralph was thinking as they covered
a clear dash of twenty miles over the best stretch
of grading on the road, and with satisfaction he
noted that they had gained three minutes on the
schedule time. He whistled for a station at
which they did not stop, set full speed again
as they left the little village behind them, and
glanced sharply at Fogg.</p>
<p>The latter had not spoken a word for over
half-an-hour. He had gone about his duties in
a dogged, sullen fashion that showed the permanency
of the grouch with which old John
Griscom had charged him. Ralph had made up
his mind to leave his cab companion severely alone
until he became more reasonable. However,
there were some things about Fogg of which the
young engineer was bound to take notice, and
a new enlightenment came to Ralph&#8217;s mind as he
now glanced at his helper.</p>
<p>Fogg had slipped clumsily on the tender plate
in using the coal rake, and Ralph had marveled
at this unusual lack of steadiness of footing.
Then, twice he had gone out on the running board
on some useless errand, fumbling about in an
inexplicable way. His hot, fetid breath crossed
Ralph&#8217;s face, and the latter arrived at a definite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
conclusion, and he was sorry for it. Fogg had
been &#8220;firing up&#8221; from a secret bottle ever since
they had left the Junction, and his condition was
momentarily becoming more serious and alarming.</p>
<p>They were slowing down to a stop at a water
tank as Ralph saw Fogg draw back, and under
cover of the tender lift a flask to his lips. Then
Fogg slipped it under the cushion of his seat as
he turned to get some coal.</p>
<p>He dropped the shovel, coal and all, with a
wild snort of rage, as turning towards the fire box
door he saw Ralph reach over swiftly, grab the
half empty bottle from under the cushion, and
give it a fling to the road bed, where it was
dashed into a thousand pieces.</p>
<p>Blood in his eye, uncontrollable fury in his
heart, the irrational fireman, both fists uplifted,
made a wild onslaught upon the young engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You impudent meddler!&#8221; he raved. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
smash you!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>A SPECIAL PASSENGER</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Behave yourself,&#8221; said Ralph Fairbanks
quietly.</p>
<p>The young engineer simply gave his furious
antagonist a push with his free hand. The other
hand was on duty, and Ralph&#8217;s eyes as well.
He succeeded in bringing the locomotive to a stop
before Fogg needed any further attention.</p>
<p>The fireman had toppled off his balance and
went flat among the coal of the tender. Ralph
did not feel at all important over so easily repelling
his assailant. Fogg was in practically a
helpless condition, and a child could have disturbed
his unsteady footing.</p>
<p>With maudlin energy, however, he began to
scramble to his feet. All the time he glowered
at Ralph, and made dreadful threats of what he
was going to do to the youth for &#8220;knocking him
down.&#8221; Fogg managed to pull himself erect, but
swayed about a good deal, and then observing
that Ralph had the free use of both hands now and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
was posed on guard to meet any attack he might
meditate, the irate fireman stooped and seized a
big lump of coal. Ralph could hardly hope to
dodge the missile, hemmed in as he was. It was
poised for a vicious fling. Just as Fogg&#8217;s hand
went backwards to aim the projectile, it was
seized, the missile was wrested from his grasp,
and a strange voice drawled out the words:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t waste the company&#8217;s coal that way,
if I were you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph with some surprise and considerable
interest noted the intruder, who had mounted the
tender step just in time to thwart the quarrelsome
designs of Lemuel Fogg. As to the fireman,
he wheeled about, looked ugly, and then as
the newcomer laughed squarely in his face, mumbled
some incoherent remark about &#8220;two against
one,&#8221; and &#8220;fixing both of them.&#8221; Then he
climbed up on the tender to direct the water tank
spout into place.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the row here, anyhow?&#8221; inquired the
intruder, with a pleasant glance at Ralph, and
leaning bodily against the fireman&#8217;s seat.</p>
<p>Ralph looked him over as a cool specimen,
although there was nothing &#8220;cheeky&#8221; about the
intruder. He showed neither the sneakiness nor
the effrontery of the professional railroad beat
or ride stealer, nothwithstanding the easy, natural
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
way in which he made himself at home in the cab
as though he belonged there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad you happened along,&#8221; chirped the newcomer
airily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll keep you company as far as
Bridgeport, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you, now?&#8221; questioned Ralph, with a
dubious smile.</p>
<p>The lad he addressed was an open-faced, smart-looking
boy. He was well dressed and intelligent,
and suggested to Ralph the average college or
home boy. Certainly there was nothing about
him that indicated that he had to work for a
living.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Clark&mdash;Marvin Clark,&#8221; continued
the intruder.</p>
<p>Ralph nodded and awaited further disclosures.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father is President of the Middletown &amp;
Western Railroad,&#8221; proceeded the stranger.</p>
<p>Ralph did not speak. He smiled slightly, and
the keen-eyed intruder noticed this and gave him
a sharp look.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old racket, eh? Too flimsy?&#8221; he propounded
with a quizzical but perfectly good-natured grin.
&#8220;I suppose they play all kinds of official relationships
and all that on you fellows, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;we do hear some pretty
extravagant stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; assented the youth calling himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
Marvin Clark. &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want to intrude,
but if there&#8217;s room for myself and my
credentials, I&#8217;d rather keep you company than
free pass it in the parlor coach. There you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the boy spoke of &#8220;credentials,&#8221; he drew an
unsealed envelope from his pocket and handed
it to Ralph. The latter received it, noting that
it bore in one corner the monogram of the Great
Northern, with &#8220;President&#8217;s office&mdash;official business&#8221;
printed under it. He withdrew the enclosure
and perused it.</p>
<p>The sheet was a letter head of the Middletown
&amp; Western Railroad. It bore on one line in one
handwriting the name &#8220;Marvin Clark,&#8221; and beneath
it the words: &#8220;For identification,&#8221; in
another handwriting, and the flourishing signature
below &#8220;Nathaniel Clark, President.&#8221;</p>
<p>In typewriting beneath all this were the words:
&#8220;Pass on all trains, Marvin Clark,&#8221; and below
that a date and the name in writing of Mr. Robert
Grant, the President of the Great Northern, unmistakably
genuine. There were few employees
on the road who were not familiar with that
signature.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Ralph, refolding the sheet, re-inclosing
it in the envelope, and handing it back
to the stranger. &#8220;I guess that passes you anywhere
on the line.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve got a sort of roaming commission,&#8221;
explained young Clark buoyantly, as
he got comfortably seated on the fireman&#8217;s
cushion. &#8220;No particular use at school, and
father wants me to learn railroading. The first
step was to run down all the lines and pick up all
the information I could. I&#8217;ve just got to put in
two months at that, and then report to family
headquarters my store of practical knowledge.
See here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marvin Clark drew a blank from his pocket.
Some thirty of its pages he showed to Ralph were
filled with memoranda. Thus: &#8220;Aug. 22, cattle
freight, Upton to Dover. O. K. Simpson, Conductor.&#8221;
There followed like items, all signed,
forming a link of evidence that the boy had been
a passenger on all kinds of rolling stock, had
visited railroad shops, switch towers, water
stations, in fact had inspected about every active
department of several railroad lines that connected
with the Middletown &amp; Western Railroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a pretty pleasant layout, I should
say,&#8221; remarked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, so, so,&#8221; replied Clark indifferently.
&#8220;Athletics is my stronghold. If I ever get money
enough&mdash;I mean if I had my own way&mdash;I&#8217;d train
for expert on everything from golf to football.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty strong in that direction myself,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
said Ralph, &#8220;but a fellow has to hustle for something
to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what that means,&#8221; declared Clark.
&#8220;Had to help the family by peddling papers&mdash;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clark paused and flushed. Ralph wondered
at the singular break his visitor had made. A
diversion covered the embarassment of the young
stranger and caused Ralph to momentarily forget
the incident. Fogg had swung back the water
spout, set the tender cover, and climbed down
into the cab. Then he took the side light signals
and went around to the pilot. No.&nbsp;999 carried
two flags there, now to be replaced by lanterns.
Fogg came back to the cab rolling up the flags.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he announced ungraciously, and
hustled Clark to one side without ceremony as the
latter abandoned his seat. Ralph gave the starting
signal and Clark edged back in the tender out of
the way.</p>
<p>The young engineer took a good look at his
fireman. The latter was muddled, it was plain
to see that, but he went about his duties with a
mechanical routine born from long experience.
Only once did he lurch towards Ralph and speak
to him, or rather hiss out the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll settle with me for your impudence yet,
young fellow. You&#8217;re a high and mighty, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
are, breaking the rules giving your friends a free
ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph did not reply. One anxiety kept him
devoted to his work&mdash;to lose no time. A glance
at the clock and schedule showed a ten minutes&#8217;
loss, but defective or experimental firing on a new
locomotive had been responsible for that, and he
counted on making a spurt, once beyond
Plympton.</p>
<p>Marvin Clark knew his place, and Ralph liked
him for keeping it. The young fellow watched
everything going on in the cab in a shrewd,
interested fashion, but he neither got in the way
of the cross-grained Fogg, nor pestered Ralph
with questions.</p>
<p>Plympton was less than five miles ahead just
as dusk began to fall. Ralph noticed that his fireman
rustled about with a good deal of unnecessary
activity. He would fire up to the limit, as
if working off some of his vengefulness and
malice. Then he went out on the running board,
for no earthly reason that Ralph could see, and
he made himself generally so conspicuous that
young Clark leaned over and said to Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with your fireman, anyhow&mdash;that
is, besides that load he&#8217;s got aboard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he has his cross moods, like all of us, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
suppose,&#8221; explained Ralph, with affected indifference.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t take him for a very pleasant comrade
at any time,&#8221; observed Clark. &#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder
he don&#8217;t take a tumble. There he is, hitching
around to the pilot. What for, I wonder?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph was not paying much attention to what
the cab passenger was saying. He had made up
five minutes, and his quick mind was now planning
how he would gain five more, and then
double that, to Plympton and beyond it.</p>
<p>He gave the whistle for Plympton, as, shooting
a curve, No.&nbsp;999 drove a clattering pace down
the grade with the lights of the station not a
quarter-of-a-mile away. They were set for clear
tracks, as they should be. Ralph gave the lever
a hitch for a rattling dash on ten miles of clear
running. Then fairly up to the first station semaphore,
he broke out with a cry so sharp and dismayed
that young Clark echoed it in questioning
excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The siding!&#8221; cried Ralph, with a jerk of the
lever&mdash;&#8220;what&#8217;s the meaning of this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; echoed Clark, in a startled tone, &#8220;that&#8217;s
quick and queer!&#8221;</p>
<p>What had happened was this: No.&nbsp;999 going
at full speed on clear signals had been sent to a
siding and the signals cancelled without a moment&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
warning. Under ordinary circumstances,
a train thus sidetracked would be under notified
control and run down the siding only a short
distance. Going at high speed, however, and
with a full head of steam on, Ralph realized that,
long as the siding was, he would have to work
quick and hard to check down the big locomotive
before she slid the limit, and stuck her nose
deep into the sand hill that blocked the terminus
of the rails.</p>
<p>It was quite dark now. The lights of the
station flashed by. Both hands in use to check
the locomotive and set the air brakes, Ralph leaned
slightly from the cab window and peered ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoot the sand!&#8221; he cried, almost mechanically.</p>
<p>It was a good thing that the cab passenger was
aboard and knew something about the cab equipment.
Young Clark reached the side of the
engineer&#8217;s seat in a nimble spring. His hand
located the sand valve without hesitancy.</p>
<p>Ralph uttered a short, sharp gasp. That look
ahead had scared him. He was doing all he
could to slow down, and was doing magnificently,
for the reverse action moved to a charm. Still,
he saw that after dashing fully two hundred
yards down the siding, the natural momentum
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
would carry the train fully one-third that distance
further.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any obstruction?&#8221; shot out his agile companion,
springing to the fireman&#8217;s seat, sticking his
head out of the window and staring ahead.
&#8220;Whew! we&#8217;re going to hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker saw what Ralph also beheld.
Dimly outlined directly in their path was a flat
car, and above it, skeletonized against the fading
sunset sky, was the framework of a derrick. A
repair or construction gondola car was straight
ahead of No.&nbsp;999.</p>
<p>They seemed to be approaching it swiftly and
irresistibly. The wheels slid now, fairly locked,
there was a marked ease-down, but Ralph saw
plainly that, great or small, a collision was inevitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that fireman of yours!&#8221; shouted young
Clark&mdash;&#8220;there he goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The locomotive was fairly upon the obstruction
now. Ralph stuck to the lever, setting his lips
firmly, a little pale, his muscles twitching slightly
under the stress of excitement and suspense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zing!&#8221; remarked the cool comrade of the
young engineer&mdash;&#8220;we&#8217;re there!&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment a flying form shot from the
running board of the locomotive. Lemuel Fogg
had jumped.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>ONE OF THE RULES</h3>
</div>
<p>Locomotive No.&nbsp;999 landed against the
bumper of the gondola car with a sharp shock.
However, there was no crash of consequence.
The headlight radiance now flooded fully the
obstruction. Young Clark suddenly shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221;</p>
<p>The quick-witted, keen-eyed special passenger
was certainly getting railroad training so coveted
by his magnate father. He saw the fireman shoot
through the air in his frightened jump for safety.
Lemuel Fogg landed in a muddy ditch at the
side of the tracks, up to his knees in water.</p>
<p>The sharp, warning cry of Marvin Clark was
not needed to appraise Ralph of the danger that
threatened. The jar of the collision had displaced
and upset the derrick. Ralph saw it falling
slantingly towards them. He pulled the reverse
lever, but could not get action quick enough to
entirely evade the falling derrick. It grazed the
headlight, chopping off one of its metal wings,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
and striking the pilot crushed in one side of the
front fender rails.</p>
<p>The young engineer gave the signal for backing
the train, and kept in motion. His purpose
was to allay any panic on the part of the passengers,
whom he knew must be alarmed by the
erratic tactics of the past few moments. Then
after thus traversing about half the distance back
to the main line, he shut off steam and whistled
for instructions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another notch in my education,&#8221; observed
young Clark with a chuckle&mdash;&#8220;been waiting to
pass examination on a smash up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this isn&#8217;t one,&#8221; replied Ralph. His tone
was tense, and he showed that he was disturbed.
He was too quick a thinker not to at once comprehend
the vital issue of the present incident.
With Fogg headed down the track towards him
from the ditch, trying to overtake the train, and
the conductor, lantern in hand, running to learn
what had happened, Ralph sized up the situation
with decided annoyance.</p>
<p>The action of the station man in giving the free
track signal and then at a critical moment shooting
the special onto the siding, had something
mysterious about it that Ralph could not readily
solve. The slight mishap to the locomotive and
the smashing of the derrick was not particularly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
serious, but there would be a report, an investigation,
and somebody would be blamed and punished.
Ralph wanted to keep a clear slate, and
here was a bad break, right at the threshold of
his new railroad career.</p>
<p>All he thought of, however, were the delays,
all he cared for at this particular moment was to
get back to the main tracks on his way for Bridgeport,
with a chance to make up lost time. A sudden
vague suspicion flashing through his mind
added to his mental disquietude: was there a plot
to purposely cripple or delay his train, so that he
would be defeated in his efforts to make a record
run?</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this tangle, Fairbanks?&#8221; shouted out
the conductor sharply, as he arrived breathless and
excited at the side of the cab.</p>
<p>His name was Danforth, and he was a model
employee of long experience, always very neat and
dressy in appearance and exact and systematic in
his work. Any break in routine nettled him, and
he spoke quite censuringly to the young engineer,
whom, however, he liked greatly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all at sea, Mr. Danforth,&#8221; confessed Ralph
bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any damage?&mdash;I see,&#8221; muttered the conductor,
going forward a few steps and surveying the
scratched, bruised face of the locomotive.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a gondola derailed and a derrick
smashed where we struck,&#8221; reported Ralph. &#8220;I
acted on my duplicate orders, Mr. Danforth,&#8221; he
added earnestly, &#8220;and had the clear signal almost
until I passed it and shot the siding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it at all,&#8221; remarked the
conductor in a troubled and irritated way. &#8220;You
had the clear signal, you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Positively,&#8221; answered Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any serious damage ahead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of consequence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back slowly, we&#8217;ll see the station man about
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conductor mounted to the cab step, and
No.&nbsp;999 backed slowly. As they neared the end
of the siding the train was again halted. All
down its length heads were thrust from coach
windows. There was some excitement and alarm,
but the discipline of the train hands and the young
engineer&#8217;s provision had prevented any semblance
of panic.</p>
<p>The conductor, lantern in hand, ran across the
tracks to the station. Ralph saw him engaged in
vigorous conversation with the man on duty there.
The conductor had taken out a memorandum book
and was jotting down something. The station
man with excited gestures ran inside the depot,
and the signal turned to clear tracks. Ralph
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
switched to the main. Then the conductor gave
the go ahead signal.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s cool,&#8221; observed young Clark. &#8220;I
should think the conductor would give us an inkling
of how all this came about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll learn soon enough,&#8221; said Ralph.
&#8220;There will have to be an official report on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m curious. Guess I&#8217;ll go back and worm out
an explanation,&#8221; spoke Clark. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you with
news later.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Clark left the cab on one side Fogg came up
on the other. He had been looking over the front
of the locomotive. Ralph noticed that he did not
seem to have suffered any damage from his wild
jump beyond a slight shaking up. He was wet
and spattered to the waist, however, and had lost
his cap.</p>
<p>Lemuel Fogg&#8217;s eyes wore a frightened, shifty
expression as he stepped to the tender. His face
was wretchedly pale, his hands trembled as he
proceeded to pile in the coal. Every vestige of
unsteadiness and maudlin bravado was gone. He
resembled a man who had gazed upon some
unexpected danger, and there was a half guiltiness
in his manner as if he was responsible for
the impending mishap.</p>
<p>The fireman did not speak a word, and Ralph
considered that it was no time for discussion or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
explanations. The injury to the locomotive was
comparatively slight, and with a somewhat worried
glance at the clock and schedule card the
young railroader focussed all his ability and attention
upon making up for lost time.</p>
<p>Soon Ralph was so engrossed in his work that
he forgot the fireman, young Clark, the accident,
everything except that he was driving a mighty
steel steed in a race against time, with either the
winning post or defeat in view. There was a
rare pride in the thought that upon him depended
a new railway record. There was a fascinating
exhilaration in observing the new king of the road
gain steadily half a mile, one mile, two miles,
overlapping lost time.</p>
<p>A smile of joy crossed the face of the young
engineer, a great aspiration of relief and triumph
escaped his lips as No.&nbsp;999 pulled into Derby
two hours later. They were twenty-one minutes
ahead of time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Fogg,&#8221; shouted Ralph across to the fireman&#8217;s
seat, &#8220;you&#8217;re a brick!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the first word that had passed between
them since the mishap at the siding, but many a
grateful glance had the young engineer cast at his
helper. It seemed as if the shake-up at Plympton
had shaken all the nonsense out of Lemuel Fogg.
Before that it had been evident to Ralph that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
fireman was doing all he could to queer the run.
He had been slow in firing and then had choked
the furnace. His movements had been suspicious
and then alarming to Ralph, but since leaving
Plympton he had acted like a different person.
Ralph knew from practical experience what good
firing was, and he had to admit that Fogg had
outdone himself in the splendid run of the last
one hundred miles. He was therefore fully in
earnest when he enthusiastically designated his
erratic helper as a &#8220;brick.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was hard for Fogg to come out from his
grumpiness and cross-grained malice quickly.
Half resentful, half shamed, he cast a furtive,
sullen look at Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t any brick that
did it&mdash;it was the briquettes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The what, Mr. Fogg?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them,&#8221; and with contemptuous indifference
Fogg pointed to a coarse sack lying among the
coal. &#8220;New-fangled fuel. Master mechanic
wanted to make a test.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I heard about that,&#8221; said Ralph
quickly. &#8220;Look like baseballs. Full of pitch, oil
and sulphur, I understand. They say they urge
up the fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They do, they burn like powder. They are
great steam makers, and no question,&#8221; observed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
Fogg. &#8220;Won&#8217;t do for a regular thing, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; insinuated Ralph attentively, glad to
rouse his grouchy helper from his morose mood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Used right along, they&#8217;d burn out any crown
sheet. What&#8217;s more, wait till you come to clean
up&mdash;the whole furnace will be choked with
cinders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; nodded Ralph, and just then they
rounded near Macon for a fifteen minutes wait.</p>
<p>As Fogg went outside with oil can and waste
roll, Mervin Clark came into the cab.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to get back where it&#8217;s home like,&#8221; he sang
out in his chirp, brisk way. &#8220;Say, Engineer Fairbanks,
that monument of brass buttons and gold
cap braid is the limit. Discipline? why, he works
on springs and you have to touch a button to
make him act. I had to chum with the brakeman
to find out what&#8217;s up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something is up, then?&#8221; inquired Ralph a
trifle uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, quite. The conductor has been writing a
ten-page report on the collision. It&#8217;s funny, but
the station man at Plympton&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;New man, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just transferred to Plympton yesterday mornin&#8217;,&#8221;
explained Clark. &#8220;Well, he swears that your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
front signals were special at the curves and flashed
green just as you neared the semaphore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Absurd!&#8221; exclaimed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the conductor says, too,&#8221; said
Clark. &#8220;He told the station agent so. They
nearly had a fight. &#8216;Color blind!&#8217; he told the
station agent and challenged him to find green
lights on No.&nbsp;999 if he could. The station man
was awfully rattled and worried. He says he
knew a special was on the list, but being new to
this part of the road he acted on Rule 23 when
he saw the green lights. He sticks to that, says
that he will positively swear to it. He says he
knows some one will be slated, but it won&#8217;t be
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does the conductor say?&#8221; inquired
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says Rule 23 doesn&#8217;t apply, as the white
lights prove. If there was any trickery or any
mistake, then it&#8217;s up to the fireman, not to the
engineer.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment, happening to glance past
Clark, the young engineer caught sight of Lemuel
Fogg. The latter, half crouching near a drive
wheel, was listening intently. The torch he carried
illuminated a pale, twitching face. His eyes
were filled with a craven fear, and Ralph tried to
imagine what was passing through his mind.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>There was something mysterious about Fogg&#8217;s
actions, yet Ralph accepted the theory of the conductor
that the station man had made a careless
blunder or was color blind.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, it isn&#8217;t that the smash up amounts
to much,&#8221; explained Clark, &#8220;but it might have,
see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I see,&#8221; replied Ralph thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then again,&#8221; continued Clark, &#8220;the conductor
says that it delayed a test run, and there&#8217;s a
scratched locomotive and a busted construction
car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thankful that no one was hurt,&#8221; said
Ralph earnestly.</p>
<p>When the next start was made, Fogg was taciturn
and gloomy-looking, but attended strictly
to his duty. Ralph voted him to be a capital fireman
when he wanted to be. As an hour after
midnight they spurted past Hopeville forty minutes
to the good, he could not help shouting over
a delighted word of commendation to Fogg.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said you were a brick, Mr. Fogg,&#8221; he
observed. &#8220;You&#8217;re more than that&mdash;you&#8217;re a
wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fogg&#8217;s face momentarily lighted up. It looked
as if he was half minded to come out of his shell
and give some gracious response, but instantly the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
old sullenness settled down over his face, accompanied
by a gloomy manner that Ralph could not
analyze. He half believed, however, that Fogg
was a pretty good fellow at heart, had started
out to queer the run, and was now sorry and
ashamed that he had betrayed his weakness for
drink.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he is genuinely sorry for his tantrums,&#8221;
reflected Ralph, &#8220;and maybe our narrow
escape at the siding has sobered him into common
sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>What the glum and gruff fireman lacked of
comradeship, the young passenger made up in
jolly good cheer. He was interested in everything
going on. He found opportunity to tell Ralph
several rattling good stories, full of incident and
humor, of his amateur railroad experiences, and
the time was whiled away pleasantly for these two
acquaintances.</p>
<p>Ralph could not repress a grand, satisfied
expression of exultation as No.&nbsp;999 glided gracefully
into the depot at Bridgeport, over forty-seven
minutes ahead of time.</p>
<p>The station master and the assistant superintendent
of the division came up to the cab
instantly, the latter with his watch in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worth waiting for, this, Fairbanks,&#8221; he called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
out cheerily&mdash;he was well acquainted with the
young railroader, for Ralph had fired freights to
this point over the Great Northern once regularly
for several weeks. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send in a bouncing
good report with lots of pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;We&#8217;ve demonstrated,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have, Fairbanks,&#8221; returned the official
commendingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only, don&#8217;t lay any stress on my part of it,&#8221;
said Ralph. &#8220;Any engineer could run such a
superb monarch of the rail as No.&nbsp;999. If you
don&#8217;t tell them how much the experiment
depended on our good friend, Fogg, here, I will
have to, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fireman flushed. His eyes had a momentary
pleased expression, and he glanced at Ralph,
really grateful. He almost made a move as if to
heartily shake the hand of his unselfish champion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too modest, Fairbanks,&#8221; laughed the
assistant superintendent, &#8220;but we&#8217;ll boost Fogg,
just as he deserves. It&#8217;s been a hard, anxious
run, I&#8217;ll warrant. We&#8217;ve got a relief crew coming,
so you can get to bed just as soon as you
like.&#8221;</p>
<p>The passenger coaches were soon emptied of
the through passengers. A local engineer, fireman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
and brakeman took charge of the train to
switch the China &amp; Japan Mail car over to another
track, ready to hitch on to the Overland express,
soon to arrive, sidetrack the other coaches, and
take No.&nbsp;999 to the roundhouse.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>A WARNING</h3>
</div>
<p>Ralph doffed his working clothes, washed up at
the tender spigot, and joined Clark, who stood
waiting for him on the platform. Fogg, without
tidying up, in a sort of tired, indifferent way was
already some distance down the platform. Ralph
hurried after him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Six-fifteen to-night, Mr. Fogg, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; spoke
Ralph, more to say something than anything else.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; returned Fogg curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Griscom directed me to a neat, quiet lodging
house,&#8221; added Ralph. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you join me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t&mdash;got some friends waiting for me,&#8221;
responded the fireman.</p>
<p>Ralph followed him seriously and sadly with
his eyes. Fogg was making for Railroad Row,
with its red saloon signs, and Ralph felt sorry
for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; spoke Clark, as they walked along
together, &#8220;headed for a bunk, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Ralph. &#8220;John Griscom, that&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
our veteran engineer, and a rare good friend of
mine, told me about a cheap, comfortable lodging
house to put up at. It&#8217;s some distance from
the depot, but I believe I shall go there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; approved Clark. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been in
some of those railroad men&#8217;s hotels yonder, and
they&#8217;re not very high toned&mdash;nor clean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your program?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got to sleep, I suppose, so, if I&#8217;m not too much
of a bore and it&#8217;s pleasing to you, I&#8217;ll try the place
your friend recommends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted,&#8221; answered Ralph.</p>
<p>Within half-an-hour both tired lads tumbled
into their beds in rooms adjoining in a private
house about half a mile from the depot. Ralph
stretched himself luxuriously, as he rested after
the turmoil and labor of what he considered the
most arduous day in his railroad career.</p>
<p>The young engineer awoke with the bright sun
shining in his face and was out of bed in a jiffy.
These lay-over days had always been prized by
the young railroader, and he planned to put the
present one to good use. He went to the closed
door communicating with the next room and
tapped on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, there!&#8221; he hailed briskly, &#8220;time to get
up,&#8221; then, no response coming, he opened the door
to find the apartment deserted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;An early bird, it seems,&#8221; observed Ralph.
&#8220;Probably gone for breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Griscom had told Ralph all about the
house he was in, and the young engineer soon
located the bathroom and took a vigorous cold
plunge that made him feel equal to the task of
running a double-header special. Ralph had just
dressed when Marvin Clark came bustling into the
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty minutes for breakfast!&#8221; hailed the
volatile lad. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been up an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t take a two hundred mile run, or
you wouldn&#8217;t be up for four,&#8221; challenged Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess that&#8217;s so,&#8221; admitted Clark. &#8220;Well, here
we are. I&#8217;ve been out prospecting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;A good restaurant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Found one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A dandy&mdash;wheat cakes with honey, prime
country sausages and Mocha, all for twenty
cents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; commended Ralph. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take air
line for that right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clark chattered like a magpie as they proceeded
to the street. It was evident that he had
taken a great fancy to Ralph. The latter liked
him in return. For the son of a wealthy railroad
magnate, Clark was decidedly democratic. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
one subject he seemed glad to avoid was any reference
to his direct family and friends.</p>
<p>He was full of life, and Ralph found him very
entertaining. Some bad breaks in grammar
showed, indeed, that he had not amounted to much
at school. Some of his adventures also suggested
that the presence and power of money had not
always been at his command. Ralph noticed some
inconsistencies in his stories here and there, but
Clark rattled on so fast and jumped so briskly
from one subject to another, that it was hard
work to check him up.</p>
<p>As they reached the porch of the house Clark
gave Ralph a deterring touch with his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wait a minute, will you?&#8221; he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why what for?&#8221; inquired Ralph in some
surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to find out something before we go
out into the street,&#8221; and the speaker glided down
the walk to the gate, peered down the street, and
then beckoned to his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he hailed. &#8220;They&#8217;re still there,
though,&#8221; he added, his tones quite impressive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just dally at the gate here and take a look past
the next street corner&mdash;near where there&#8217;s an
alley, see?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That crowd of boys?&#8221; questioned Ralph, following
his companion&#8217;s direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that gang of hoodlums,&#8221; responded Clark
bluntly, &#8220;for that is what they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how are we interested in them?&#8221; inquired
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not, but they may become interested in
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mightily, if I don&#8217;t mistake my cue,&#8221; asserted
Clark.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are pretty mysterious,&#8221; hinted Ralph,
half-smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll explain. Those fellows are laying
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Laying for me?&#8221; repeated Ralph vaguely.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? They don&#8217;t know me, and I don&#8217;t
know them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much acquainted at Bridgeport, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only casually. I&#8217;ve laid over here several
times when I was firing on the fast freight. I
know a few railroad men, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever hear of Billy Bouncer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m the first one to enlighten you.
When I went out to find a restaurant I passed that
crowd you see. I noticed that they drew together
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
and scanned me pretty closely. Then I heard
one of them say, &#8216;That&#8217;s not Fairbanks.&#8217; &#8216;Yes, it
is, didn&#8217;t he come out of the place we&#8217;re watching?&#8217;
said another. &#8216;Aw, let up,&#8217; spoke a third
voice. &#8216;Billy Bouncer will know, and we don&#8217;t
want to spoil his game. He&#8217;ll be here soon.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s strange,&#8221; said Ralph musingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do about it?&#8221; inquired
Clark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not at all alarmed,&#8221; replied Ralph,
&#8220;barely interested, that&#8217;s all. We&#8217;ll walk by the
crowd and see if they won&#8217;t throw some further
light on the subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell you, Fairbanks,&#8221; said Clark quite seriously,
&#8220;I&#8217;m putting two and two together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; laughed Ralph, &#8220;that makes four&mdash;go
ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More than four&mdash;a regular mob. That crowd,
as I said, for some reason is laying for you.
What&#8217;s the answer? They have been put up to
it by some one. You know, you told me incidentally
that you had some enemies on account of
the big boost you&#8217;ve got in the service. You said,
too, that your friend, Engineer Griscom, warned
you on just that point. I haven&#8217;t said much so
far, but the actions of that grouch fireman of
yours, Fogg, looked decidedly queer and suspicious
to me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>Ralph made no comment on this. He had his
own ideas on the subject, but did not feel warranted
in fully expressing them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that Fogg started out on your run
yesterday to queer it. Why he changed tactics
later, I can&#8217;t tell. Maybe he was scared by the
smash-up on the siding. Anyhow, I never saw
such mortal malice in the face of any man as that
I saw in his when I came aboard No.&nbsp;999. This
crowd down the street is evidently after you.
Some one has put them up to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t mean Fogg!&#8221; exclaimed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Clark.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that he would plot against me
that far,&#8221; declared Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;A malicious enemy will do anything to reach
his ends,&#8221; said Clark. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t he want you
knocked out? Doesn&#8217;t he want your place?
What would suit his plans better than to have you
so mauled and battered, that you couldn&#8217;t show up
for the return trip to Stanley Junction this afternoon?
Are you going past that crowd?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly shall not show the white feather by
going out of my way,&#8221; replied Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s your disposition, I&#8217;m at your
call if they tackle us,&#8221; announced Clark.</p>
<p>They proceeded down the street, and Ralph as
they advanced had a good view of the crowd,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
which, according to the views of his companion,
was laying in wait for him. There were about
fifteen of them, ranging from selfish-faced lads
of ten or so up to big, hulking fellows of twenty.
They represented the average city gang of idlers
and hoodlums. They were hanging around the
entrance to the alley as if waiting for some mischief
to turn up. Ralph noticed a rustling among
them as he was observed. They grouped
together. He fancied one or two of them pointed
at him, but there was no further indication of
belligerent attention as he and Clark approached
nearer to the crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy Billy Bouncer, whoever he is, hasn&#8217;t
arrived yet,&#8221; observed Clark.</p>
<p>Just then one of the mob set up a shout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi there, Wheels!&#8221; he hailed, and some additional
jeers went up from his fellows. Their
attention seemed directed across the street, and
Ralph and Clark glanced thither.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>AT BAY</h3>
</div>
<p>A queer-looking boy about eighteen years of
age was proceeding slowly down the pavement.
He was stockily built, and had an unusually massive
head and great broad shoulders. He was a
boy who would be remarked about almost anywhere.
His hair was long, and this gave him a
somewhat leonine aspect.</p>
<p>The hat of this boy was pushed far back on
his head, and his eyes were fixed and his attention
apparently deeply absorbed upon an object he
held in his hand. This was a thin wooden rod
with two cardboard wheels attached to it. These
he would blow, causing them to revolve rapidly.
Then he would study their gyrations critically,
wait till they had run down, and then repeat the
maneuver.</p>
<p>His side coat pockets were bulging, one with a
lot of papers. From the other protruded what
seemed to be a part of a toy, or some real mechanical
device having also wheels in its construction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s a queer make-up!&#8221; observed
Clark in profound surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is certainly eccentric in his appearance,&#8221;
said Ralph. &#8220;I wonder who he can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, what he can be,&#8221; corrected Clark, &#8220;for
he&#8217;s an odd genius of some kind, I&#8217;ll wager.&#8221;</p>
<p>The object of their interest and curiosity had
heard the derisive hail from across the street.
He halted dead short, stared around him like a
person abruptly aroused from a dream, traced the
call to its source, thrust the device with which he
had been experimenting into his pocket, and fixing
his eyes on his mockers, started across the street.
The hoodlum crowd nudged one another, blinked,
winked, and looked as if expecting developments
of some fun. The object of their derision looked
them over in a calculating fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did any one here speak to me?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Wheels&mdash;it was the birdies calling you!&#8221;
hooted a jocose voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sort of suggest something, somehow,&#8221;
drawled the lad in an abstracted, groping way.
&#8220;Yes, certainly, let me see. What is it? Ah, perhaps
I&#8217;ve made a memorandum of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lad poked into several vest pockets. Finally
he unearthed a card which seemed to be all written
over, and he ran his eye down this. The crowd
chuckled at the profound solemnity of his manner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; observed the boy designated as
&#8220;Wheels.&#8221; &#8220;Let me see. &#8216;Get shoes mended.&#8217;
No, that isn&#8217;t it. I have such a bad memory.
&#8216;Order some insulated wire.&#8217; No, that&#8217;s for an
uptown call. &#8216;Buy Drummond on Superheated
Steam.&#8217; That&#8217;s for the bookstore. Ah, here we
have it. &#8216;Kick Jim Scroggins.&#8217; Who&#8217;s Jim?
Aha! you young villain, I remember you well
enough now,&#8221; and with an activity which could
scarcely be anticipated from so easy-going an individual,
Wheels made a dive for a big hulking fellow
on the edge of the crowd. He chased him a
few feet, and planted a kick that lifted the yelling
hoodlum a foot from the ground. Then, calmly
taking out a pencil, he crossed off the memorandum&mdash;&#8220;Kick
Jim Scroggins&#8221;&mdash;gave the crowd a
warning glance, and proceeded coolly down the
sidewalk, resuming his occupation with the contrivance
he had placed in his pocket.</p>
<p>The gang of loafers had drawn back. A sight
of the massive arms and sledge hammer fists of
the young giant they had derided, and his prompt
measures with one of their cronies, dissuaded
them from any warlike move.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoop!&#8221; commented Clark in an exultant
undertone, and he fairly leaned against his companion
in a paroxysm of uncontrollable laughter.
&#8220;Quick, nifty and entertaining, that! Say Engineer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
Fairbanks, I don&#8217;t know who that fellow
Wheels is, but I&#8217;d be interested and proud to make
his acquaintance. Now steam up and air brake
ready, while we pass the crossing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Passing the crossing,&#8221; as Clark designated it,
proved, however, to be no difficult proceeding.
The crowd of hoodlums had got a set-back from
the boy with the piston-rod arm, it seemed. They
scanned Ralph and Clark keenly as they passed
by, but made no attempt to either hail or halt
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve run the gauntlet this time,&#8221; remarked
Clark. &#8220;Hello&mdash;four times!&#8221;</p>
<p>The vigilant companion of the young engineer
was glancing over his shoulder as he made this
sudden and forcible remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four times what?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;That fireman of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Fogg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; replied Clark, edging close to Ralph,
&#8220;just take a careless backward look, will you?
About half the square down on the opposite side
of the street you&#8217;ll see Fogg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why such caution and mystery?&#8221; propounded
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you later. See him?&#8221; inquired Clark,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
as Ralph followed out the suggestion he had
made.</p>
<p>Ralph nodded assentingly. He had made out
Fogg as Clark had described. The fireman was
walking along in the direction they were proceeding.
There was something stealthy and sinister
in the way in which he kept close to the buildings
lining the sidewalk.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s four times I&#8217;ve noticed Fogg in this
vicinity this morning,&#8221; reported Clark. &#8220;I discovered
him opposite the lodging house when I
first came out this morning. When I came back
he was skulking in an open entry, next door.
When we left the house together I saw him a
block away, standing behind a tree. Now he bobs
up again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand his motive,&#8221; said Ralph
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can,&#8221; declared Clark with emphasis.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your theory?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no theory at all, it&#8217;s a dead certainty,&#8221;
insisted Clark. &#8220;Your fireman and that gang of
hoodlums hitch together in some way, you mark
my words. Well, let it slide for a bit. I&#8217;m hungry
as a bear, and here&#8217;s the restaurant.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a neat and inviting place, and with appetizing
zeal the two boys entered and seated themselves
at a table and gave their order for wheat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
cakes with honey and prime country sausages.
Just as the waiter brought in the steaming meal,
Clark, whose face was toward the street, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fogg just passed by, and there goes the crowd
of boys. I&#8217;m thinking they&#8217;ll give us a chance to
settle our meal, Engineer Fairbanks!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; responded Ralph quietly, &#8220;if that&#8217;s
the first task of the day, we&#8217;ll be in trim to tackle
it with this fine meal as a foundation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their youthful, healthy appetites made a feast
of the repast. Clark doubled his order, and Ralph
did full credit to all the things set before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking,&#8221; he remarked, as they paid
their checks at the cashier&#8217;s counter, &#8220;that we
might put in the day looking around the town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; assented his companion approvingly,
&#8220;that is, if you&#8217;re going to let me keep with
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; smiled Ralph. &#8220;You seem to
think I may need a guardian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got nothing to do but put in the time,
and get a signed voucher from you that I did so
in actual railroad service and in good company,&#8221;
explained Clark. &#8220;I think I will go back to Stanley
Junction on your return run, if it can be
arranged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is arranged already, if you say so,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
Ralph. &#8220;We seem to get on together pretty well,
and I&#8217;m glad to have you with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s handsome, Engineer Fairbanks!&#8221;
replied Clark. &#8220;There&#8217;s some moving picture
shows in town here, open after ten o&#8217;clock, and
there&#8217;s a mechanics&#8217; library with quite a museum
of railroad contrivances. We&#8217;ve got time to take
it all in. Come on. Unless that crowd stops us,
we&#8217;ll start the merry program rolling. No one
in sight,&#8221; the youth continued, as they stepped into
the street and he glanced its length in both directions.
&#8220;Have the enemy deserted the field, or are
they lying in ambush for us?&#8221;</p>
<p>They linked arms and sauntered down the pavement.
They had proceeded nearly two squares,
when, passing an alley, both halted summarily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! here&#8217;s business, I guess,&#8221; said Clark,
and he and Ralph scanned closely the group they
had passed just before the breakfast meal.</p>
<p>The hoodlum gang had suddenly appeared from
the alleyway, and forming a circle, surrounded
them. There was an addition to their ranks.
Ralph noted this instantly. He was a rowdy-looking
chunk of a fellow, and the swing of his
body, the look on his face and the expression in
his eyes showed that he delighted in thinking himself
a &#8220;tough customer.&#8221; Backed by his comrades,
who looked vicious and expectant, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
marched straight up to Ralph, who did not flinch a
particle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look like Fairbanks to me&mdash;Fairbanks,
the engineer,&#8221; he observed, fixing a glance upon
Ralph meant to dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is my name,&#8221; said Ralph quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; asserted the big fellow, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking
for you, and I&#8217;m going to whip the life out of
you.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>FOUR MEDALS</h3>
</div>
<p>Marvin Clark stepped promptly forward at
the announcement of the overgrown lout, who
had signified his intention of whipping the young
engineer of No.&nbsp;999. Clark had told Ralph that
athletics was his strong forte. He looked it as
he squared firmly before the bully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to wallop somebody, are you?&#8221; spoke
Clark cooly. &#8220;Watch the system-cylinder&#8221;&mdash;and
the speaker gave to his arms a rotary motion so
rapid that it was fairly dizzying, &#8220;or piston rods,&#8221;
and one fist met the bulging breast of the fellow
with a force that sent him reeling backwards several
feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, there! you keep out of this, if you don&#8217;t
want to be massacreed!&#8221; spoke a voice at Clark&#8217;s
elbow, and he was seized by several of the rowdy
crowd and forced back from the side of Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands off!&#8221; shouted Clark, and he cleared a
circle about him with a vigorous sweep of his
arms.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you mix in a fair fight, then,&#8221; warned a
big fellow in the crowd, threateningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s going to be a fair fight, is it?&#8221;
demanded Clark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see to it that it is,&#8221; remarked Clark briefly.</p>
<p>The fellow he had dazed with his rapid-fire
display of muscle had regained his poise, and was
now again facing the young engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understand?&#8221; he demanded, hunching up his
shoulders and staring viciously at Ralph. &#8220;I&#8217;m
Billy Bouncer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221; said Ralph simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, and don&#8217;t you forget it. I happen to
have got a tip from my uncle, John Evans, of
Stanley Junction. I guess you know him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; announced Ralph bluntly, &#8220;and if you
are as mean a specimen of a boy as he is of a man,
I&#8217;m sorry for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; roared the young ruffian, raising his
fists. &#8220;Do you see that?&#8221; and he put one out,
doubled up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, and it&#8217;s mighty dirty, I can tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Insult me, do you? I guess you don&#8217;t know
who I am. Champion, see?&mdash;light-weight champion
of this burg, and I wear four medals, and
here they are,&#8221; and Bouncer threw back his coat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
and vauntingly displayed four gleaming silver
discs pinned to his vest.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had four more, big as cartwheels, I
don&#8217;t see how I would be interested,&#8221; observed
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t?&#8221; yelled Bouncer, hopping mad at
failing to dazzle this new opponent with an acquisition
that had awed his juvenile cohorts and
admirers. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;ll grind you to powder!
Strip.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this Bouncer threw off his coat, and there
was a scuffle among his minions to secure the
honor of holding it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t intend to strip,&#8221; remarked Ralph, &#8220;and
I don&#8217;t want to strike you, but you&#8217;ve got to open
a way for myself and my friend to go about our
business, or I&#8217;ll knock you down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll&#8211;&#8211;Fellows, hear him!&#8221; shrieked
Bouncer, dancing from foot to foot. &#8220;Oh, you
mincemeat! up with your fists! It&#8217;s business
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young engineer saw that it was impossible
to evade a fight. The allusion of Bouncer to Jim
Evans was enlightening. It explained the animus
of the present attack.</p>
<p>If Lemuel Fogg had been bent on queering the
special record run to Bridgeport out of jealousy,
Evans, a former boon companion of the fireman,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
had it in for Ralph on a more malicious basis.
The young railroader knew that Evans was capable
of any meanness or cruelty to pay him back
for causing his arrest as an incendiary during the
recent railroad strike on the Great Northern.</p>
<p>There was no doubt but what Evans had
advised his graceless nephew of the intended visit
of Ralph to Bridgeport. During the strike Evans
had maimed railroad men and had been guilty of
many other cruel acts of vandalism. Ralph
doubted not that the plan was to have his precious
nephew &#8220;do&#8221; him in a way that he would not be
able to make the return trip with No.&nbsp;999.</p>
<p>The young engineer was no pugilist, but he
knew how to defend himself, and he very quickly
estimated the real fighting caliber of his antagonist.
He saw at a glance that Billy Bouncer was
made up of bluff and bluster and show. The
hoodlum made a great ado of posing and exercising
his fists in a scientific way. He was so
stuck up over some medal awards at amateur
boxing shows, that he was wasting time in displaying
his &#8220;style.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you ready?&#8221; demanded Bouncer, doing a
quickstep and making a picturesque feint at his
opponent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me pass,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow, when I&#8217;ve eaten you up, maybe!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Since you will have it, then,&#8221; observed Ralph
quietly, &#8220;take that for a starter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young engineer struck out once&mdash;only once,
but he had calculated the delivery and effect of
the blow to a nicety. There was a thud as his
fist landed under the jaw of the bully, so quickly
and so unexpectedly that the latter did not have
time to put up so much as a pretense of a
protection.</p>
<p>Back went Billy Bouncer, his teeth rattling, and
down went Billy Bouncer on a backward slide.
His head struck a loose paving brick. He moaned
and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four&mdash;medals!&#8221; he voiced faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Clark,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>He snatched the arm of his new acquaintance
and tried to force his way to the alley opening.
Thus they proceeded a few feet, but only a few.
A hush had fallen over Bouncer&#8217;s friends, at the
amazing sight of their redoubtable champion gone
down in inglorious defeat, but only for a moment.
One of the largest boys in the group rallied the
disorganized mob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out with your smashers!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
let them get away!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph pulled, or rather forced his companion
back against two steps with an iron railing, leading
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
to the little platform of the alley door of a
building fronting on the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;No show making a break,&#8221; he continued in
rapid tones. &#8220;Look at the cowards!&#8221;</p>
<p>At the call of their new leader, the crowd to its
last member whipped out their weapons. They
were made of some hard substance like lead, and
incased in leather. They were attached to the
wrist by a long loop, which enabled their possessors
to strike a person at long range, the object of
the attack having no chance to resist or defend
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grab the railing,&#8221; ordered Clark, whom Ralph
was beginning to recognize as a quick-witted fellow
in an emergency. &#8220;Now then, keep side by
side&mdash;any tactics to hold them at bay or drive
them off.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two friends had secured quite a tactical
position, and they proceeded to make the most of
it. The mob with angry yells made for them
direct. They jostled one another in their eager
malice to strike a blow. They crowded close to
the steps, and their ugly weapons shot out from
all directions.</p>
<p>One of the weapons landed on Ralph&#8217;s hand
grasping the iron railing, and quite numbed and
almost crippled it. A fellow used his weapon as
a missile, on purpose or by mistake. At all events,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
it whirled from his hand through the air, and
striking Clark&#8217;s cheek, laid it open with quite a
ghastly wound. Clark reached over and snatched
a slungshot from the grasp of another of the
assaulting party. He handed it quickly to his
companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Use it for all it&#8217;s worth,&#8221; he suggested rapidly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let them down us, or we&#8217;re goners.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Clark, nettled with pain, balanced
himself on the railing and sent both feet flying
into the faces of the onpressing mob. These
tactics were wholly unexpected by the enemy.
One of their number went reeling back, his nose
nearly flattened to his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rush &#8217;em!&#8221; shouted the fellow frantically.</p>
<p>Half-a-dozen of his cohorts sprang up the steps.
They managed to grab Ralph&#8217;s feet. Now it was
a pull and a clutch. Ralph realized that if he
ever got down into the midst of that surging mob,
or under their feet, it would be all over with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all up with us!&#8221; gasped Clark with a
startled stare down the alley. &#8220;Fogg, Lemuel
Fogg!&#8221;</p>
<p>The heart of the young engineer sank somewhat
as he followed the direction of his companion&#8217;s
glance. Sure enough, the fireman of No.&nbsp;999 had
put in an appearance on the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming like a cyclone!&#8221; said Clark.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>Fogg was a rushing whirlwind of motion. He
was bareheaded, and he looked wild and uncanny.
Somewhere he had picked up a long round clothes
pole or the handle to some street worker&#8217;s outfit.
With this he was making direct for the crowd
surrounding Ralph and Clark. Just then a slungshot
blow drove the latter to his knees. Two of the
crowd tried to kick at his face. Ralph was nerved
up to desperate action now. He caught the
uplifted foot of one of the vandals and sent him
toppling. The other he knocked flat with his fist,
but overpowering numbers massed for a headlong
rush on the beleaguered refugees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swish&mdash;thud! swish!&#8221; Half blinded by a
blow dealt between the eyes by a hurling slungshot,
the young engineer could discern a break in
the program, the appearance of a new element that
startled and astonished him. He had expected to
see the furious Fogg join the mob and aid them
in finishing up their dastardly work. Instead, like
some madman, Fogg had waded into the ranks of
the group, swinging his formidable weapon like a
flail. It rose, it fell, it swayed from side to side,
and its execution was terrific.</p>
<p>The fireman mowed down the amazed and scattering
forces of Billy Bouncer as if they were
rows of tenpins. He knocked them flat, and then
he kicked them. It was a marvel that he did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
cripple some of them, for, his eyes glaring, his
muscles bulging to the work, he acted like some
fairly irresponsible being.</p>
<p>Within two minutes&#8217; time the last one of the
mob had vanished into the street. Flinging the
pole away from him, Fogg began looking for
his cap, which had blown off his head as he came
rushing down the alley at cyclone speed.</p>
<p>Clark stared at the fireman in petrified wonder.
Ralph stood overwhelmed with uncertainty and
amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Fogg, I say, Mr. Fogg!&#8221; he cried, running
after the fireman and catching at his sleeve, &#8220;How&mdash;why&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boy,&#8221; choked out Lemuel Fogg, turning a
pale, twitching face upon Ralph, &#8220;don&#8217;t say a
word to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then with a queer, clicking sob in his
throat, the fireman of No.&nbsp;999 hastened down the
alley looking for his cap.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>DAVE BISSELL, TRAIN BOY</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it at all,&#8221; exclaimed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mad&mdash;decidedly mad,&#8221; declared young Clark.
&#8220;Whew! that was a lively tussle. All the buttons
are gone off my vest and one sleeve is torn
open clear to the shoulder, and I guess there were
only basting threads in that coat of yours, for
it&#8217;s ripped clear up the back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clark began to pick up some scattered buttons
from the ground. His companion, however, was
looking down the alley, and he followed Fogg
with his eyes until the fireman had disappeared
into the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wondering about things,&#8221; spoke Clark.
&#8220;So am I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to figure out the puzzle, yes,&#8221;
admitted the young engineer. &#8220;You see, we were
both of us wrong, and we have misjudged Mr.
Fogg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; dissented Ralph&#8217;s
companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he has helped us, instead of hurt us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Clark, &#8220;but why? It&#8217;s nonsense
to say that he didn&#8217;t start out on your trip fixed
up to put you out of business if he could do it.
It is folly, too, to think that he didn&#8217;t know that
this Billy Bouncer, relative of that old-time enemy
of yours back at Stanley Junction, Jim Evans, had
put this gang up to beat you. If that wasn&#8217;t so,
why has he been hanging around here all the
morning in a suspicious, mysterious way, and how
does he come to swoop down on the mob just in
the nick of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he was planning to head off the crowd
all the time,&#8221; suggested Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not from the very start,&#8221; declared Clark positively.
&#8220;No, sir&mdash;I think he has had a fit of
remorse, and thought better of having you banged
up or crippled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At all events, Fogg has proven a good friend
in need, and I shall not forget it soon,&#8221; observed
Ralph.</p>
<p>When they came out into the street the hoodlum
crowd had dispersed. They entered the first
tailor shop they came to and soon had their
clothing mended up.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a moving picture show open,&#8221; said
Clark, after they had again proceeded on their
way. &#8220;Let&#8217;s put in a half-hour or so watching
the slides.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>This they did. Then they strolled down to the
shops, took in the roundhouse, got an early dinner,
and went to visit the museum at the Mechanics&#8217;
Exchange. This was quite an institution of
Bridgeport, and generally interested railroad men.
Clark was very agreeable to the proposition made
by his companion to look over the place. They
found a fine library and a variety of drawings
and models, all along railroad lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;This suits me exactly,&#8221; declared Clark. &#8220;I
am not and never will be a practical railroader,
but I like its variety just the same. Another thing,
a fellow learns something. Say, look there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker halted his companion by catching
his arm abruptly, as they turned into a small
reading room after admiring a miniature reproduction
in brass of a standard European
locomotive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I see,&#8221; nodded Ralph, with a slight smile
on his face, &#8220;our friend, Wheels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both boys studied the eccentric youth they had
seen for the first time a few hours previous. He
occupied a seat at a desk in a remote corner of
the room. Propped up before him was a big volume
full of cuts of machinery, and he was taking
notes from it. A dozen or more smaller books
were piled up on a chair beside him.</p>
<p>Young as he was, there was a profound solemnity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
and preoccupation in his methods that suggested
that he had a very old head on a juvenile
pair of shoulders. As Ralph and his companion
stood regarding the queer genius, an attendant
came up to Wheels. He touched him politely on
the shoulder, and as the lad looked up in a dazed,
absorbed way, pointed to the clock in the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;You told me to inform you when it was two
o&#8217;clock,&#8221; spoke the attendant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I, now?&#8221; said Wheels in a lost, distressed
sort of a way. &#8220;Dear me, what for, I wonder?&#8221;
and he passed his hand abstractedly over his forehead.
&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;ll find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>He proceeded to draw from his pocket the selfsame
memorandum he had consulted in the case of
Jim Scroggins. He mumbled over a number of
items, and evidently struck the right one at last,
for he murmured something about &#8220;catch the
noon mail with a letter to the patent office,&#8221; arose,
put on his cap, and hurriedly left the place, blissfully
wool-gathering as the fact that noon had
come and gone several hours since.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m curious,&#8221; observed Clark, and as Wheels
left the place he followed the attendant to the
library office, and left Ralph to stroll about alone,
while he engaged the former in conversation. In
about five minutes Clark came back to Ralph with
a curious but satisfied smile on his face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got his biography,&#8221; he announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose&mdash;Wheels?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he, anyway?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;He thinks he is a young inventor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an open question. They call him
Young Edison around here, and his right name
is Archie Graham. His father was an aeronaut
who was an expert on airships, got killed in an
accident to an aeroplane last year, and left his
son some little money. Young Graham has been
dabbling in inventions since he was quite young.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he really ever invent anything of consequence?&#8221;
asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;The attendant here says that he did. About
two years ago he got up a car window catch that
made quite a flurry at the shops. It was used with
good results, and the Great Northern was about
to pay Graham something for the device, when it
was learned that while he was bringing it to perfection
some one else had run across pretty nearly
the same idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And patented it first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both abroad and in this country. That of
course shut Graham out. All the same, the attendant
declares that Graham must have got the idea
fully a year before the foreign fellow did.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>The boys left the place in a little while and proceeded
towards the railroad depot. Ralph had
conceived quite a liking for his volatile new
acquaintance. Clark had shown himself to be a
loyal, resourceful friend, and the young engineer
felt that he would miss his genial company if the
other did not take the return trip to Stanley Junction.
He told Clark this as they reached the
depot.</p>
<p>&#8220;That so?&#8221; smiled the latter. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll go
sure if you&#8217;re agreeable. I&#8217;ve got no particular
program to follow out, and I&#8217;d like to take in the
Junction. Another thing, I&#8217;m curious to see how
you come out with your friends. There&#8217;s that
smash-up on the siding at Plympton, too. Something
may come up on that where I may be of
service to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>They found the locomotive, steam up, on one of
the depot switches in charge of a special engineer.
It lacked over half an hour of leaving time.
While Clark hustled about the tender, Ralph
donned his working clothes and chattered with the
relief engineer. The latter was to run the locomotive
to the train, and Ralph walked down the
platform to put on the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve stowed my vest in a bunker in the cab,&#8221;
said Clark, by his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; nodded Ralph.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m going to get some sandwiches and a
few bottles of pop for a little midnight lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed the young engineer, as his
companion started over towards Railroad Row.</p>
<p>Lemuel Fogg had not put in an appearance up
to this time, but a few minutes later Ralph saw
him in the cab of No.&nbsp;999, which he had gained
by a short cut from the street. As Ralph was
looking in the direction of the locomotive, some
one came briskly up behind him and gave him a
sharp, friendly slap on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Ralph Fairbanks!&#8221; he hailed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Dave Bissell!&#8221; said the young railroader,
turning to face and shake hands with an
old acquaintance. Dave had been a train boy on
an accommodation run at Stanley Junction about
a year previous, and had graduated into the same
line of service on the Overland Limited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad to see you,&#8221; said Ralph; &#8220;I hear
you&#8217;ve got a great run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Famous, Fairbanks!&#8221; declared Dave. &#8220;I&#8217;m
hearing some big things about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You call them big because you remember the
Junction and exaggerate home news,&#8221; insisted
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so, but I always said you&#8217;d be president
of the road some time,&#8221; began Dave, and then with
a start stared hard at young Clark, who appeared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
at that moment crossing the platform of a stationary
coach from the direction of Railroad
Row. &#8220;Why!&#8221; exclaimed Dave, &#8220;hey! hi! this
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clark had halted abruptly. His expressive features
were a study. As he evidently recognized
Dave, his face fell, his eyes betokened a certain
consternation, and dropping a package he carried
he turned swiftly about, jumped from the platform
and disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&#8221; spoke Ralph, considerably surprised,
&#8220;do you know Marvin Clark?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; bolted out Dave bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That boy&mdash;Marvin Clark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marvin Clark nothing!&#8221; shouted the train boy
volubly. &#8220;That&#8217;s my cousin, Fred Porter, of
Earlville.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>AN ASTONISHING DISCOVERY</h3>
</div>
<p>The young engineer of No.&nbsp;999 faced a new
mystery, a sharp suspicion darted through his
mind. He recalled instantly several queer breaks
that the special passenger had made in his
conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your cousin, is he?&#8221; observed Ralph
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what he is,&#8221; affirmed Dave Bissell.</p>
<p>&#8220;And his name is Fred Porter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always has been,&#8221; declared Dave. &#8220;Why,
something up? Humph! I can guess. Bet he&#8217;s
been up to some of his old tricks. He always was
a joker and full of mischief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me more about him,&#8221; suggested Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, there isn&#8217;t much to tell,&#8221; said Dave.
&#8220;He and I were raised at Earlville. His parents
both died several years ago, and he wandered
around a good deal. This is the first I&#8217;ve seen of
him for over two years.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Might you not be mistaken&mdash;facial
resemblance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; observed Dave staunchly. &#8220;Think
I don&#8217;t recognize my own relatives? Why, didn&#8217;t
you notice how he acted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, surprised.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, scared,&#8221; corrected Dave, &#8220;and ran away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; demanded Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, from your seeming to know him under
another name, I should say because he is found
out. What game has he been playing on you,
Fairbanks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has done me more good than harm,&#8221;
evaded Ralph. &#8220;I&#8217;ve only known him since
yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he has run away, that&#8217;s certain. That
bothers me. Fred Porter was never a sneak or a
coward. He was full of jolly mischief and fun,
but a better friend no fellow ever had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He struck me that way,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;I hope
he&#8217;ll come back. There&#8217;s my engine coming, and
I&#8217;ll have to go on duty. Try and find him, Dave,
will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you find him, tell him I must see him
before we leave Bridgeport.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph picked up the lunch package that his odd
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
acquaintance had dropped and moved along the
platform to where No.&nbsp;999 had run. The locomotive
was backed to the coaches and the relief engineer
stepped to the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; he projected in an undertone to Ralph,
&#8220;what&#8217;s up with Fogg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything?&#8221; questioned Ralph
evasively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dizzy in the headlight and wobbly in the drivers,
that&#8217;s all,&#8221; came the response, with a wink.</p>
<p>Ralph&#8217;s heart sank as he entered the cab. Its
atmosphere was freighted with the fumes of
liquor, and a single glance at the fireman convinced
him that Fogg was very far over the line
of sobriety. Ralph hardly knew how to take
Fogg. The latter nodded briefly and turned away,
pretending to occupy himself looking from the
cab window. Ralph could not resist the impulse
to try and break down the wall of reserve between
them. He stepped over to the fireman&#8217;s side and
placed a gentle hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Fogg,&#8221; he said in a friendly tone,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to say something or do something to
square accounts for your help in routing that
crowd this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you speak of it!&#8221; shot out the fireman
fiercely. &#8220;It&#8217;s over and done, isn&#8217;t it? Let it
drop.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; laughed Ralph genially. &#8220;Say, I
saw a dispatch in the Bridgeport paper to-day
from Stanley Junction that ought to make you feel
pretty good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did?&#8221; snapped Fogg, determinedly antagonistic
and stubbornly keeping his face turned
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It gave the list of names of those in our
district who passed an examination as school
teachers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph observed that a tremor ran through the
fireman&#8217;s frame at this intelligence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;who was in it?&#8221; he questioned, his
voice hoarse and tense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two from the Junction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and the one who led with the highest
average was your daughter, Nellie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t deserve it!&#8221; fairly sobbed the fireman,
getting up suddenly and striving to hide his
emotion. &#8220;Boy!&#8221; and he trembled all over as he
now faced Ralph, &#8220;I&#8217;m steamed up again, as you
can plainly see. I won&#8217;t deny it, but I had to, I
couldn&#8217;t fire a mile unless I steamed up, but I&#8217;ll
say one thing with truth&mdash;I&#8217;ve got no bottle in
the cab.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good, Mr. Fogg,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;And never will have again, and you&#8217;ve seen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
the last signs of the dirty stuff on me. I&#8217;m going
home to make a new start.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven bless you in your new resolution, Mr.
Fogg!&#8221; cried Ralph, his own tones none too
steady.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll have something to say to you after
we get home,&#8221; continued Fogg. &#8220;Just leave me
alone till then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something was working on the mind of the
fireman, this was very plain&mdash;something for good,
Ralph fervently hoped. The young engineer took
his cue promptly. During all the trip to Stanley
Junction he avoided all conversation except commonplace
routine remarks. Up to the time of
leaving Bridgeport Ralph had waited expectantly
for some sign of the youth he had known as Marvin
Clark. Clark or Porter, his new acquaintance
did not put in an appearance, nor did Dave Bissell
return.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave did not succeed in finding him,&#8221; decided
Ralph, as No.&nbsp;999 started up. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; Dave
had been pretty positive as to the identity of his
cousin, and the elusive actions of his relative
seemed to verify his recognition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traveling under false colors, I fear,&#8221; reflected
the young engineer. &#8220;A pretty bold and difficult
imposture, I should think. Are his credentials
false or stolen? But how to explain his motive?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
He doesn&#8217;t like railroading, and the system and
the vouchers he is at so much trouble to get and
preserve make this business decidedly mysterious.
If it wasn&#8217;t for those features, I would feel it
my duty to report the affair and notify the real
Marvin Clark, if there is one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph had both mind and hands full during the
trip. As to Fogg, he went straight about his
duties, grimly silent and mechanically. As the
fire and vim of stimulation died down, Ralph
could see that it was with the most exhaustive
effort that his fireman kept up his nerve and
strength. Fogg was weak and panting the last
shovel full of coal he threw into the furnace, as
they sighted Stanley Junction. He was as limp
as a rag, and looked wretched as the train rolled
into the depot.</p>
<p>They ran the locomotive to the roundhouse.
Ralph went at once to the foreman&#8217;s office, while
Fogg attended to the stalling of No.&nbsp;999. He
found the night watchman asleep there and no
orders on the blackboard for Fogg or himself.
This meant that they need not report before noon.</p>
<p>Ralph looked around for the fireman when he
came out of the office, but the latter had disappeared,
probably headed for home. Ralph, half-across
the turntable, halted and went over to
No.&nbsp;999.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The vest of that mysterious new acquaintance
of mine, Clark&mdash;Porter,&#8221; said Ralph&mdash;&#8220;he said
he left it in the locomotive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph did not find the article in question in his
own bunker. He threw back the cover of Fogg&#8217;s
box, to discover the vest neatly folded up at the
bottom of that receptacle. With some curiosity
he looked over its pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; whistled Ralph, as he removed and
opened the only article it contained&mdash;a check book.
The checks were upon a bank at Newton. About
half of what the book had originally contained
had been removed. Examining the stubs, Ralph
calculated that over $1,000 had been deposited at
the bank in the name of Marvin Clark, and that
fully half that amount had been checked out.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is pretty serious,&#8221; commented the young
engineer. &#8220;It looks as if the impostor has not
only stolen Clark&#8217;s name, but his passes and his
check book as well. I don&#8217;t like the looks of
this. There&#8217;s something here I can&#8217;t figure out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph placed the check book in his own pocket
and returned the vest to the box. As he did this,
he disturbed a piece of cloth used by Fogg to wipe
grease from the cab valves. Something unfamiliar
to the touch was outlined wrapped up in the
rag, and Ralph explored.</p>
<p>Two objects came into view as he opened the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
piece of cloth. With a great gasp the young engineer
stared at these. Then he rolled up the rag
and placed it and its contents in his pocket.</p>
<p>His face grew grave, and Ralph uttered a deep
sigh, startled and sorrowful.</p>
<p>The young engineer of No.&nbsp;999 had made a
discovery so strange, so unexpected, that it fairly
took his breath away.</p>
<p>The mystery of the collision on the siding at
Plympton was disclosed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE LIGHT OF HOME</h3>
</div>
<p>Ralph walked home in the quiet night in a
serious and thoughtful mood. His usually bright
face was clouded and his head bent, as though
his mind was greatly upset. As the light of home
came into view, however, with a effort he cast
aside all railroad and personal cares.</p>
<p>&#8220;Always the same dear, faithful mother,&#8221; he
murmured gratefully, as he approached the cheerful
looking cottage all alight down stairs, and hurried
his steps to greet her waiting for him on the
porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph,&#8221; she spoke anxiously, &#8220;you are not
hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt!&#8221; cried Ralph, &#8220;not a bit of it. Why,&#8221;
as he noticed his mother trembling all over, &#8220;what
put that into your head?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fear that what Zeph heard downtown at
the roundhouse might be true,&#8221; replied Mrs. Fairbanks.
&#8220;There was a rumor that there had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
a collision. Besides, I knew that some of your
enemies were watching your movements.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must stop worrying over these foolish
notions,&#8221; said Ralph reassuringly. &#8220;We made a
successful run, and as to the enemies, they generally
get the worst of it. Men in the wrong always
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph was glad to get back to his comfortable
home. As he passed through the hallway he
noticed Zeph Dallas, asleep on the couch. Ralph
did not hail or disturb him. Young Dallas had
been at work for the friends of Ralph who operated
the Short Line Railroad up near Wilmer,
but about two weeks previous to the present time
had got tired of the dull route through the woods
and had come to Stanley Junction. The young
engineer had gotten him a job &#8220;subbing&#8221; as a
helper on a yards switch engine. Zeph had been
made welcome at the Fairbanks home, as were all
friends of Ralph, by his devoted mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the best mother and the best cook in
the world,&#8221; declared Ralph, as he sat down at the
table in the cozy little dining room, before a warm
meal quickly brought from the kitchen. &#8220;Really,
mother, you are simply spoiling me, and as to
your sitting up for me this way and missing your
sleep, it is a positive imposition on you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>His mother only smiled sweetly and proudly
upon him. Then she asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it a hard trip, Ralph?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way,&#8221; responded Ralph. &#8220;But what made
it harder was some unpleasant developments
entirely outside of railroad routine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That so? It never rains but it pours!&#8221; proclaimed
an intruder abruptly, and, awakened from
his sleep by the sound of voices, Zeph Dallas came
into the dining room yawning and stretching
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; exclaimed Ralph, giving the intruder
a quick stare, &#8220;what have you ever been doing to
yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; grinned Zeph&mdash;&#8220;you mean that black
eye and that battered cheek?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;accident?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;incident,&#8221; corrected Zeph, with a
chuckle. &#8220;A lively one, too, I can tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fell off the engine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, fell against a couple of good hard human
fists. We had been sorting stray freights all the
afternoon on old dinky 97, and had sided to let a
passenger go by, when I noticed a man with a
bag and a stick picking up coal along the tracks.
Just then, a poor, ragged little fellow with a basket
came around the end of the freight doing the
same. The man thought he had a monopoly in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
his line, because he was big. He jumped on the
little fellow, kicked him, hit him with his stick,
and&mdash;I was in the mix-up in just two seconds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should keep out of trouble, Zeph,&#8221;
advised Mrs. Fairbanks, gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I, ma&#8217;am, when that little midget
was getting the worst of it?&#8221; demurred Zeph.
&#8220;Well, I pitched into the big, overgrown bully,
tooth and nail. I&#8217;m a sight, maybe. You ought
to see him! He cut for it after a good sound
drubbing, leaving his bag of coal behind him. I
gave the little fellow all the loose change I had,
filled his basket from the bag, and sent him home
happy. When I got back to the engine, Griggs,
the assistant master mechanic, was in the cab. He
said a few sharp words about discipline and the
rules of the road, and told me to get off the
engine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Discharged, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And to stay off. I&#8217;m slated, sure. Don&#8217;t
worry about it, Fairbanks; I&#8217;d got sick to death of
the job, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what are you going to do?&#8221; inquired
Ralph gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get another one, of course. I&#8217;m going to try
to get Bob Adair, the road detective, to give me
a show. That&#8217;s the line of work I like. If he
won&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll try some other town. I&#8217;m sorry, Fairbanks,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
for my wages will only settle what board I
owe you, and there&#8217;s that last suit of clothes you
got for me, not paid for yet&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t trouble yourself about that, Zeph,&#8221;
interrupted Ralph kindly. &#8220;You&#8217;re honest, and
you&#8217;ll pay when you can. You may keep what
money you have for a new start until you get to
work again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeph looked grateful. Then Ralph gave some
details of the record run to Bridgeport, there was
some general conversation, and he went to bed.</p>
<p>Ralph had asked his mother to call him at nine
o&#8217;clock in the morning, but an hour before that
time there was a tap at the door of the bedroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph, dear,&#8221; spoke up his mother, &#8220;I dislike
to disturb you, but a messenger boy has just
brought a telegram, and I thought that maybe it
was something of importance and might need
immediate attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, mother. I will be down stairs
in a minute,&#8221; answered the young railroader, and
he dressed rapidly and hurried down to the sitting
room, where his mother stood holding out to him
a sealed yellow envelope. Ralph tore it open.
He looked for a signature, but there was none.
It was a night message dated at Bridgeport, the
evening previous, and it ran:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; '>&#8220;Clark&mdash;Porter&mdash;whatever you know don&#8217;t
speak of it, or great trouble may result. Will see
you within two days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what the next development will be?&#8221;
murmured Ralph. &#8220;&#8216;Great trouble may result.&#8217;
I don&#8217;t understand it at all. &#8216;Will see you in two
days&#8217;&mdash;then there is some explanation coming.
Clark, or whatever his real name is, must suspect
or know that his cousin, Dave Bissell, has told me
something. Well, I certainly won&#8217;t make any
move about this strange affair until Clark has
had an opportunity to straighten things out. In
the meantime, I&#8217;ve got a good deal of personal
business on my hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph was a good deal in doubt and anxious as
to his railroad career, immediate and prospective.
As has been told, his trip to Bridgeport had been
a record run. The fact that the China &amp; Japan
Mail could be delivered on time, indicated a possibility
that the Great Northern might make a feature
of new train service. It would not, however,
be done in a day. No.&nbsp;999 might be put on the
Dover branch of the Great Northern, or accomodation
service to other points, and the Overland
Express connection canceled.</p>
<p>There had been all kinds of speculation and
gossip at the dog house as to the new system
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
of business expansion adopted by the Great
Northern. That road had acquired new branches
during the past year, and was becoming a big
system of itself. There was talk about a consolidation
with another line, which might enable the
road to arrange for traffic clear to the Pacific.
New splendid train service was talked of everywhere,
among the workmen, and every ambitious
railroader was looking for a handsome and substantial
promotion.</p>
<p>Ralph could not tell until he reported at the
roundhouse after twelve o&#8217;clock when and how
he would start out again. On the Bridgeport run
he was not due until the next morning. All he
was sure of was that he and Fogg were regulars
for No.&nbsp;999 wherever that locomotive was
assigned, until further orders interfered. Despite
the successful record run to Bridgeport,
somebody was listed for at least a &#8220;call-down&#8221; on
account of the accident on the siding at Plympton.
Every time Ralph thought of that, he recollected
his &#8220;find&#8221; in Lemuel Fogg&#8217;s bunker, and
his face became grave and distressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bound to come out,&#8221; he reflected, as he
strolled into the neat, attractive garden after
breakfast. &#8220;Why, Mr. Griscom&mdash;I&#8217;m glad to see
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>His old railroad friend was passing the house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
on his way to the roundhouse to report for duty.
His brisk step showed that he was limited as to
time, but he paused for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got there, Fairbanks, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; he
commented heartily. &#8220;Good. I knew you would,
but say, what about this mix-up on the signals
at Plympton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that wasn&#8217;t much,&#8221; declared Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough to put the master mechanic on his
mettle,&#8221; objected the veteran engineer. &#8220;He&#8217;s
going to call all hands on the carpet. Had me in
yesterday afternoon. He showed me your conductor&#8217;s
report wired from Bridgeport. It throws
all the blame on Adams, the new station man at
Plympton. The conductor declares it was all
his fault&mdash;&#8216;color blind,&#8217; see? Master mechanic
had Adams down there yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely no action is taken yet?&#8221; inquired
Ralph anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I fancy Adams will go. It&#8217;s a plain
case, I think. Your signals were special and clear
right of way, that&#8217;s sure. Danforth is ready to
swear to that. Adams quite as positively swears
that the green signals on the locomotive were set
on a call for the siding. He broke down and cried
like a child when it was hinted that a discharge
from the service was likely.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Poor fellow, I must see the master mechanic
at once,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to, for your explanation goes with
him and will settle the affair. You see, it seems
that Adams had broken up his old home and gone
to the trouble and expense of moving his family
to Plympton. Now, to be let out would be a pretty
hard blow to him. Of course, though, if he is
color blind&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not color blind!&#8221; cried Ralph, with so
much earnestness that Griscom stared at him
strangely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha! so you say that, do you?&#8221; observed
the old engineer, squinting his eyes suspiciously.
&#8220;Then&mdash;Fogg. Tricks, I&#8217;ll bet!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to you later, Mr. Griscom,&#8221; said
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good, I want to know, and I see you have
something to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young engineer had, indeed, considerable
to tell when the time came to justify the disclosures.
He was worried as to how he should
tell it, and to whom. Ralph sat down in the
little vine-embowered summer-house in the garden,
and had a good hard spell of thought. Then,
as his hand went into his pocket and rested on
the piece of cloth with its enclosure which he had
found in Fogg&#8217;s bunker on No.&nbsp;999, he started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
from his seat, a certain firm, purposeful expression
on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to do it,&#8221; he said to himself, as
he went along in the direction of the home of
Lemuel Fogg. &#8220;Somebody has got to take the
responsibility of the collision. Adams, the new
station man at Plympton, is innocent of any
blame. It would be a terrible misfortune for
him to lose his job. Fogg has sickness in his
family. The truth coming out, might spoil all
the future of that bright daughter of his. As to
myself&mdash;why, if worse comes to worse, I can
find a place with my good friends on the Short
Line Railway down near Dover. I&#8217;m young, I&#8217;m
doing right in making the sacrifice, and I&#8217;m not
afraid of the future. Yes, it is a hard way for
a fellow with all the bright dreams I&#8217;ve had, but&mdash;I&#8217;m
going to do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>The young engineer had made a grand, a
mighty resolve. It was a severe struggle, a hard,
bitter sacrifice of self interest, but Ralph felt that
a great duty presented, and he faced its exactions
manfully.</p>
<p>The home of Lemuel Fogg the fireman was
about four blocks distant. As Ralph reached it,
he found a great roaring fire of brush and rubbish
burning in the side yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;A good sign, if that is a spurt of home industry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
with Fogg,&#8221; decided the young railroader.
&#8220;He&#8217;s tidying up the place. It needs it bad
enough,&#8221; and Ralph glanced critically at the disordered
yard.</p>
<p>Nobody was astir about the place. Ralph knew
that Mrs. Fogg had been very ill of late, and
that there was an infant in the house. He decided
to wait until Fogg appeared, when he
noticed the fireman way down the rear alley.
His back was to Ralph and he was carrying a
rake. Fogg turned into a yard, and Ralph started
after him calculating that the fireman was returning
the implement to a neighbor. Just as Ralph
came to the yard, the fireman came out of it.</p>
<p>At a glance the young engineer noted a change
in the face of Fogg that both surprised and
pleased him. The fireman looked fresh, bright and
happy. He was humming a little tune, and he
swung along as if on cheerful business bent, and
as if all things were coming swimmingly with
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, Mr. Fogg?&#8221; hailed Ralph.</p>
<p>The fireman changed color, a half-shamed,
half-defiant look came into his face, but he clasped
the extended hand of the young railroader and
responded heartily to its friendly pressure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got something to tell you, Fairbanks,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
said, straightening up as if under some striving
sense of manliness.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; nodded Ralph with a smile.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to the house with you, and will
be glad to have a chat with you. First, though,
I want to say something to you, so we&#8217;ll pause
here for a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve&mdash;I&#8217;ve made a new start,&#8221; stammered Fogg.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve buried the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried Ralph, giving his companion a
hearty slap on the shoulder, &#8220;that&#8217;s just what I
was going to say to you. Bury the past&mdash;yes,
deep, fathoms deep, without another word, never
to be resurrected. To prove it, let&#8217;s first bury this.
Kick it under that ash heap yonder, Mr. Fogg,
and forget all about it. Here&#8217;s something that
belongs to you. Put it out of sight, and never
speak of it or think of it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Ralph handed to the fireman the package
done up in the oiling cloth that he had unearthed
from Fogg&#8217;s bunker in the cab of No.&nbsp;999.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>FIRE!</h3>
</div>
<p>Lemuel Fogg gave a violent start as he received
the parcel from Ralph&#8217;s hand. His face
fell and the color deserted it. The package unrolled
in his grasp, and he let it drop to the
ground. Two square sheets of green colored
mica rolled out from the bundle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks!&#8221; spoke the fireman hoarsely, his
lips quivering&mdash;&#8220;you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I surmise a great deal,&#8221; replied Ralph promptly,
&#8220;and I want to say nothing more about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have figured it all out. Adams, the station
man at Plympton, has a family. You are going
to turn over a leaf, I have decided to take all the
blame for the collision on the siding. I shall
see the master mechanic within an hour and settle
everything. I am going to resign my position
with the Great Northern road.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fireman&#8217;s jaws dropped at this amazing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
declaration of the young railroader. It seemed
as if for a moment he was fairly petrified at the
unexpected disclosure of the noble self-sacrifice
involved. He did not have to explain what those
two sheets of green mica signified&mdash;Ralph knew
too well. Inspired by jealousy, Lemuel Fogg had
slipped them over the white signal lights of No.&nbsp;999
as the locomotive approached Plympton, getting
the siding semaphore, and removing them
before the smash-up had come about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; shouted Fogg suddenly. &#8220;Let me
tell you, Fairbanks&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the speaker could finish the sentence
Ralph seized his arm with the startling words:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Fogg, look&mdash;fire!&#8221;</p>
<p>Facing about, Lemuel Fogg uttered a frightful
cry as he discerned what had just attracted the
notice of the young engineer. The Fogg house
was in flames.</p>
<p>When Ralph had first noticed the fiercely-burning
heap of rubbish on the Fogg premises, he had
observed that it was dangerously near to the
house. It had ignited the dry light timber of the
dwelling, the whole rear part of which was now
a mass of smoke and flames.</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife&mdash;my helpless wife and the little
child!&#8221; burst from the lips of the frantic fireman
in a shrill, ringing scream.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>Ralph joined him as he ran down the alley on
a mad run. The great sweat stood out on the
bloodless face of the agonized husband and father
in knobs, his eyes wore a frenzied expression of
suspense and alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Save them! save them!&#8221; he shouted, as Ralph
kept pace with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get excited, Mr. Fogg,&#8221; spoke Ralph
reassuringly. &#8220;We shall be in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she cannot move&mdash;she is in the bedroom
directly over the kitchen. Oh, this is a judgment
for all my wickedness!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be a man,&#8221; encouraged Ralph. &#8220;Here we are&mdash;let
me help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Up the back stairs!&#8221; cried Fogg. &#8220;They are
nearest to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no&mdash;you can never get up them,&#8221; declared
Ralph.</p>
<p>The side door of the house was open, showing
a pair of stairs, but they were all ablaze. Smoke
and sparks poured up this natural funnel fiercely.
Ralph caught at the arm of his companion
and tried to detain him, but Fogg broke away
from his grasp.</p>
<p>Ralph saw him disappear beyond the blazing
barrier. He was about to run around to the front
of the house, when he heard a hoarse cry. Driven
back by the overpowering smoke, Fogg had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
stumbled. He fell headlong down a half a dozen
steps, his head struck the lower platform, and he
rolled out upon the gravel walk, stunned.</p>
<p>Ralph quickly dragged the man out of the range
of the fire and upon the grass. He tried to arouse
Fogg, but was unsuccessful. There was no time
to lose. Seizing a half-filled bucket standing by
the well near by, Ralph deluged the head of the
insensible fireman with its contents. It did not revive
him. Ralph sped to the front of the house,
ran up on the stoop and jerked at the knob of the
front screen door.</p>
<p>It was locked, but Ralph tore it open in an instant.
A woman&#8217;s frantic screams echoed as the
young railroader dashed into the house. He was
quickly up the front stairs. At the top landing
he paused momentarily, unable to look about him
clearly because of the dense smoke that permeated
the place.</p>
<p>Those frenzied screams again ringing out
guided him down a narrow hallway to the rear
upper bedroom. The furniture in it was just
commencing to take fire. On the floor was the
fireman&#8217;s wife, a tiny babe held in one arm, while
with the other she was trying unsuccessfully to
pull herself out of range of the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Save me! save me!&#8221; she shrieked, as Ralph&#8217;s
form was vaguely outlined to her vision.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be alarmed, Mrs. Fogg,&#8221; spoke Ralph
quickly&mdash;&#8220;there&#8217;s no danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ran to the bed, speedily pulled off a blanket
lying there, and wrapped it about the woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold the child closely,&#8221; he directed, and bodily
lifted mother and babe in his strong, sinewy
arms. The young railroader staggered under his
great burden as he made for the hallway, but
never was he so glad of his early athletic training
as at this critical moment in his life.</p>
<p>It was a strenuous and perilous task getting
down the front stairs with his load, but Ralph
managed it. He carried mother and child clear
out into the garden, placed them carefully on a
rustic bench there, and then ran towards the well.</p>
<p>By this time people had come to the scene of the
fire. There were two buckets at the well. A
neighbor and the young railroader soon formed a
limited bucket brigade, but it was slow work hauling
up the water, and the flames had soon gained a
headway that made their efforts to quench them
useless.</p>
<p>Ralph organized the excited onlookers to some
system in removing what could be saved from the
burning house. In the meantime he had directed a
boy to hasten to the nearest telephone and call out
the fire department. Soon the clanging bell of the
hose cart echoed in the near distance. The rear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
part of the house had been pretty well burned
down by this time, and the front of the building
began to blaze.</p>
<p>Ralph got a light wagon from the barn of a
neighbor. A comfortable couch was made of
pillows and blankets, and Mrs. Fogg and her
child were placed on this. Ralph found no difficulty
in enlisting volunteers to haul the wagon to
his home, where his mother soon had the poor
lady and her babe in a condition of safety and
comfort. As Ralph returned to the dismantled
and still smoking Fogg home he met a neighbor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Fairbanks,&#8221; spoke this person, &#8220;you&#8217;re in
great demand up at the Foggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fogg has come to. They told him about
your saving his wife and child. He cried like a
baby at first. Then he insisted on finding you.
He&#8217;s blessing you for your noble heroism, I tell
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about the noble heroism,&#8221; returned
Ralph with a smile. &#8220;Go back, will you,
and tell him I&#8217;ll see him in about an hour. Tell
him to come down to our house at once. It&#8217;s all
arranged there to make him feel at home until he
can make other arrangements.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a mighty good fellow, Fairbanks&#8221; declared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
the man enthusiastically, &#8220;and everybody
knows it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; returned Ralph, and proceeded
on his way. As he casually looked at his watch
the young railroader quickened his steps with the
half-murmured words:</p>
<p>&#8220;And now for a tussle with the master mechanic.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE MASTER MECHANIC</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Want to resign, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what I came here for, sir,&#8221; said the
young engineer of No.&nbsp;999.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re too late,&#8221; and the master mechanic
of the Great Northern seemed to turn his
back on Ralph, busying himself with some papers
on his desk. He was a great, gruff fellow with
the heart of a child, but he showed it rarely. A
diamond in the rough, most of the employees of
the road were afraid of him. Not so Ralph. The
young railroader had won the respect and admiration
of the official by his loyalty and close
attention to duty. In fact, Ralph felt that the
influence of the master mechanic had been considerable
of an element in his promotion to No.&nbsp;999.
He stepped nearer to the desk, managing to
face the would-be tyro.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late, sir?&#8221; he repeated vaguely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I say so? Get out!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>The master mechanic waved his hand, and
Ralph was a trifle surprised at what seemed a
peremptory dismissal. The moving arm of the
old railroader described a swoop, grasped the
hand of Ralph in a fervent grip, and pulling the
young engineer to almost an embrace, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks, we had in our family a little boy
who died. It&#8217;s a pretty tender memory with us,
but every time I look at you I think of the dear
little fellow. He&#8217;d have been a railroader, too, if
he had lived, and the fondest wish of my heart is
that he might have been like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; murmured the astonished Ralph.</p>
<p>The master mechanic cleared his throat and his
great hand swept the moisture from his eyes.
Then in a more practical tone he resumed:</p>
<p>&#8220;I said you was too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late for what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Resigning. You are too late,&#8221; observed the
official, &#8220;because Lemuel Fogg has already been
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To tender his resignation, to tell the whole
truthful story of the collision on the siding at
Plympton. Fairbanks,&#8221; continued the master mechanic
very seriously, &#8220;you are a noble young
fellow. I know your design to bear the whole
brunt of the smash-up, in order that you might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
save your fireman and the station man down at
Plympton. As I said, Fogg was here. I never
saw a man so broken. He told me everything.
He told me of your patience, of your kindness,
your manliness. Lad, your treatment of Fogg
under those circumstances shows the mettle in you
that will make you a great man, and, what is
better still, a good man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said Ralph in a subdued tone,
deeply affected despite himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first time in twenty years&#8217; service,&#8221;
continued the official, &#8220;I am going to take a serious
responsibility on myself which should be
rightly shouldered by the company. The Plympton
incident is dead and buried. The three of us
must hold always the secret close. The black
mark is rubbed off the slate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have done right&mdash;oh, believe me, sir!&#8221; declared
Ralph earnestly. &#8220;I feel sure that Mr.
Fogg has learned a lesson that he will never forget,
and the blessings of his sick wife, of his ambitious
young daughter, will be yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In my desk yonder,&#8221; continued the master
mechanic, &#8220;I have his written pledge that drink
is a thing of the past with him. I told Fogg that
if ever he disappointed me in my belief that he
was a changed man, a reformed man, I would
leave the service feeling that my mistaken judgment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
did not do justice to my position with the
Great Northern. As to you, ready to sacrifice
yourself for the sake of others&mdash;you are a young
man among thousands. Drop it now&mdash;get out!&#8221;
ordered the master mechanic, with a vast show of
authority. &#8220;It&#8217;s all under seal of silence, and I
expect to see you and Fogg make a great team.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Fogg&#8217;s house has just burned down,&#8221; said
Ralph. &#8220;It would have broken him down completely,
if his discharge had been added to that
misfortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Burned down?&#8221; repeated the master mechanic,
in surprise and with interest. &#8220;How was that?&#8221;
and Ralph had to recite the story of the fire. He
added that he had heard Fogg had but little insurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; directed the official, and he
went into the next office. Ralph heard him dictating
something to his stenographer. Then the
typewriter clicked, and shortly afterwards the
master mechanic came into the office with a sheet
of foolscap, which he handed to Ralph. A pleased
flush came into the face of the young railroader
as he read the typewritten heading of the sheet&mdash;it
was a subscription list in behalf of Lemuel
Fogg, and headed by the signature of the master
mechanic, with &#8220;$20&#8221; after it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are a noble man!&#8221; cried Ralph irresistibly.
&#8220;No wonder it&#8217;s a joy to work for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Down brakes there!&#8221; laughed the big-hearted
fellow. &#8220;Don&#8217;t draw it too strong, Fairbanks.
Don&#8217;t be more liberal than you can afford now,&#8221;
he directed, as Ralph placed the paper on the desk,
and added to it his subscription for $10. &#8220;You
can tell Fogg we&#8217;re rising a few pennies for him.
I&#8217;ll circulate the subscription among the officials,
and if any plan to have the roundhouse crowd chip
in a trifle comes to your mind, why, start it down
the rails. Get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; cried Ralph. &#8220;You&#8217;ve said that
twice, so I guess it&#8217;s time to go now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One minute, though,&#8221; added the master mechanic.
&#8220;You and Fogg will run No.&nbsp;999 on the
Tipton accommodation to-morrow. It&#8217;s a shift
berth, though. I don&#8217;t want you to go dreaming
quite yet, Fairbanks, that you&#8217;re president of the
Great Northern, and all that, but, under the hat,
I will say that you can expect a boost. We are
figuring on some big things, and I shouldn&#8217;t wonder
if a new train is soon to be announced that
will wake up some of our rivals. Get out now
for good, for I&#8217;m swamped with work here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young engineer left the office of the master
mechanic with a very happy heart. Affairs had
turned out to his entire satisfaction, and, too,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
for the benefit of those whose welfare he had
considered beyond his own. Ralph was full of
the good news he had to impart to Lemuel Fogg.
As he left the vicinity of the depot, he began to
formulate a plan in his mind for securing a subscription
from his fellow workers to aid Fogg.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; suddenly remarked Ralph to himself
with a queer smile, and halting in his progress,
&#8220;talk about coincidences, here is one for certain.
&#8216;The Overland Limited,&#8217; why, I&#8217;ve got an idea!&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Overland Limited&#8221; had been in Ralph&#8217;s
mind ever since leaving the office of the master
mechanic. There could be only one solution to
the hint that official had given of &#8220;new trains that
would wake up some of the rivals of the Great
Northern.&#8221; That road had recently bought up
two connecting lines of railroad. The China &amp;
Japan Mail experiment&mdash;could it be a test as to
the possibility of establishing an &#8220;Overland Special?&#8221;
At all events, there was a pertinent suggestion
in the words that met the gaze of the
young engineer and caused him to halt calculatingly.</p>
<p>A newly-painted store front with clouded windows
had a placard outside bearing the announcement:
&#8220;Olympia Theatre, 10-cent show. Will
open next Saturday evening with the following
special scenes: 1&mdash;The Poor Artist. 2&mdash;London
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
by Gaslight. 3&mdash;A Day on the Overland Limited.&#8221;
At the door of the store just being renovated
for a picture show stood a man, tying some
printed bills to an awning rod for passers by to
take. Ralph approached this individual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to open a moving picture show?&#8221; he
inquired in a friendly way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; responded the show man. &#8220;Interested?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the public will be. It&#8217;s a sort of experiment,
with two other shows in town. There&#8217;s
none in this locality, and they tell me I&#8217;ll do well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think so,&#8221; answered Ralph. &#8220;Bright,
clean pictures will draw a good crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to get the railroad men in touch with
me. They and their families could give me lots
of business. There&#8217;s that prime &#8216;Overland&#8217; scene.
It&#8217;s a new and fine film.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it has suggested something to me that
you may be glad to follow out,&#8221; spoke Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s that, neighbor?&#8221; inquired the
showman curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; responded Ralph. &#8220;There was a
fire in town to-day&mdash;one of the best-known firemen
on the road was burned out. It&#8217;s a big blow
to him, for he&#8217;s lost about all he had. There isn&#8217;t
a railroad man in Stanley Junction who would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
not be glad to help him get on his feet again. The
big fellows of the road will subscribe in a good
way, but the workers can&#8217;t spare a great deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; nodded the man. &#8220;What are you getting
at, though?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just this,&#8221; explained Ralph. &#8220;You get out
some special dodgers and announce your opening
night as a benefit for Lemuel Fogg, fireman. Offer
to donate fifty per cent. of the proceeds to
Fogg, and I&#8217;ll guarantee to crowd your house to
the doors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; enthused the man, slapping Ralph boisterously
on the shoulder, &#8220;you&#8217;re a natural showman.
Write me the dodger, will you, and I&#8217;ll have
it over the streets inside of twenty-four hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m better at filling in time schedules than composing
show bills,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll have a try
at this one for my friend&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph went inside and was soon busy with blank
paper and pencil, which the showman provided.
His composition was a very creditable piece of literary
work, and the showman chuckled immensely,
and told Ralph that he could consider
himself on the free list&mdash;&#8220;with all his family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph made a start for home again, but his
fixed plans were scheduled for frequent changes,
it seemed. An engineer friend, on his way to the
roundhouse, met him, and Ralph turned and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
walked that way with him. He broached the subject
nearest to his heart, and soon had his companion
interested in the subscription for Lemuel
Fogg. When he parted with the man at the end
of the depot platform the latter had promised to
be responsible for great results among his fellow-workmen.</p>
<p>The young engineer now proceeded in the direction
of home. The whistle of the western accommodation,
however, just arriving, held him stationary
for a few moments, and he stood watching
the train roll into the depot with the interest ever
present with a railroader.</p>
<p>The last coach was a chair car. As the coaches
jolted to a halt, there crawled or rather rolled
from under the chair car a forlorn figure, weakened,
tattered, a stowaway delivered from a perilous
stolen ride on the trucks.</p>
<p>It was a boy; Ralph saw that at a glance. As
the depot watchman ran forward to nab this
juvenile offender against the law, the boy sat up
on the board plankway where he had landed, and
Ralph caught a sight of his face.</p>
<p>In an instant the young railroader recognized
this new arrival. It was &#8220;Wheels,&#8221; otherwise
Archie Graham, the boy inventor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>A GOOD FRIEND</h3>
</div>
<p>RALPH could not repress a smile at a sight of
the erratic youth. The young inventor, it seemed,
was always coming to light in some original way.
His last sensational appearance fitted in naturally
to his usual eccentric methods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, there! trying to beat the railroad, eh?&#8221;
shouted the depot official officer, rushing forward
to nab the culprit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t arrest him, Mr. Brooks,&#8221; spoke Ralph
quickly. &#8220;I know him; I&#8217;m interested in him. He
is no professional ride-stealer, and I am perfectly
satisfied that he never went to all that risk and discomfort
because he didn&#8217;t have the money to pay
his fare.&#8221;</p>
<p>The watchman was an old-time friend of Ralph.
He looked puzzled, but he halted in his original intention
of arresting the stowaway. Young Graham
paid no attention to anything going on about
him. He seemed occupied as usual with his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
thoughts solely. First he dug cinders out of his
blinking eyes. Then he rubbed the coating of
grime and soot from his face, and began groping
in his pockets. Very ruefully he turned out one
particular inside coat pocket. He shook his head
in a doleful way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone!&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Lost my pocket book.
Friend&mdash;a pencil, quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>These words he spoke to Ralph, beckoning him
earnestly to approach nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;And a card, a piece of paper, anything I can
write on. Don&#8217;t delay&mdash;hurry, before I forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph found a stub of a pencil and some railroad
blanks in his pocket, and gave them to the
young inventor. Then the latter set at work, becoming
utterly oblivious of his surroundings. For
nearly two minutes he was occupied in making
memoranda and drawing small sections of curves
and lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, got it, good!&#8221; he voiced exultantly,
as he returned the pencil to Ralph and carefully
stowed the slips of paper in his pocket. Then he
arose to his feet. He smiled queerly as he gazed
down at his tattered garments and grimed and
blistered hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty looking sight, ain&#8217;t I?&#8221; he propounded
to the young engineer. &#8220;Had to do it, though.
Glad I did it. Got the actual details, see?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What of, may I ask?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;New idea. Save fuel, make the engine go
faster. Been figuring on it for months,&#8221; explained
the strange boy. &#8220;I live at Bridgeport.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; nodded Ralph. &#8220;I saw you
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did? Glad of that, too. If you feel friendly
enough, maybe you&#8217;ll advise me what to do in my
distressing plight. Stranger here, and lost my
pocketbook. It fell out of my pocket while I was
hanging on to the trucks. Not a cent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That can be fixed all right, I think,&#8221; said
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clothes all riddled&mdash;need a bath.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better come with me to the hotel, Mr.
Graham,&#8221; spoke Ralph. &#8220;I know enough about
you to be interested in you. I will vouch for you
to the hotel keeper, who will take care of you until
you hear from home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Got money in the bank at Bridgeport,&#8221;
said Archie Graham. &#8220;As I was telling you, I&#8217;ve
struck a new idea. You know I&#8217;ve been trying to
invent something for a number of years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve heard about that, and sincerely hope
you will figure out a success.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stick at it, anyway,&#8221; declared Archie. &#8220;Well,
at Bridgeport they take me as a joke, see? That&#8217;s
all right; I&#8217;ll show them, some day. They voted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
me a nuisance at the shops and shut me out.
Wouldn&#8217;t let me come near their engines. I had
to find out some things necessary to my inventions,
so I came on to Stanley Junction. Rode in
a coach like any other civilized being until I got
about ten miles from here&mdash;last stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there I stepped out of the coach and under
it. Whew! but it was an experience I&#8217;ll never
try again. All the same, I got what I was after.
I wanted to learn how many revolutions an axle
made in so many minutes. I wanted to know, too,
how a belt could be attached under a coach. I&#8217;ve
got the outlines of the facts, how to work out my
invention: &#8216;Graham&#8217;s Automatic Bellows Gearing.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph did not ask for further details as to the
device his companion had in mind. He led a
pleasant conversation the way from the depot, and
when they reached the hotel introduced Archie to
its proprietor.</p>
<p>&#8220;This friend of mine will be all right for what
he orders, Mr. Lane,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m going to stay here some days, perhaps
a week or two,&#8221; explained the young inventor,
&#8220;so, if you&#8217;ll give me a blank check I&#8217;ll fill it for
what cash I may need. You put it through your
bank and the funds will be here to-morrow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>Everything was arranged in a satisfactory way,
even to Archie ordering a new suit of clothes. The
youth came out temporarily from his usual profundity,
and had a real, natural boyish talk with
Ralph. The latter recited the incident of the
adventure with Billy Bouncer&#8217;s crowd at Bridgeport.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that Jim Scroggins fellow,&#8221; said Archie,
with a smile. &#8220;Yes, I remember&mdash;&#8216;kick him
Scroggins.&#8217; You see, he had broken into my
workshop, destroyed some devices I was working
on and stole a lot of my tools. So you&#8217;re Mr.
Fairbanks? I&#8217;ve heard of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph, you mean, Mr. Graham,&#8221; observed the
young railroader pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Archie, you mean,&#8221; added his eccentric
companion. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to be friends with you, for
I can see you are the right sort. You&#8217;ve done a
good deal for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t notice that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you can do a good deal more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed? How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By getting me free range of your roundhouse
here. Can you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be glad to do it,&#8221; answered Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will,&#8221; said Archie gratefully.
&#8220;They don&#8217;t know me here, and they won&#8217;t poke
fun at me or hinder me. I&#8217;m not going to steal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
any of their locomotives. I just want to study
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you to-morrow
and fix things for you, so you will be
welcome among my railroad friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a royal good fellow, Mr. Ralph,&#8221; declared
the young inventor with enthusiasm, &#8220;and
I don&#8217;t know how to thank you enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve tried to do something for humanity
to-day,&#8221; reflected the young engineer brightly, as
he wended his way homewards. &#8220;It comes easy
and natural, too, when a fellow&#8217;s trying to do his
level best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph found his mother bustling about at a
great rate when he reached home. The excitement
over the fire had died down. Fogg was up
at the ruins getting his rescued household belongings
to a neighborly shelter. The string of excited
friends to condole with Mrs. Fogg had
dwindled away, and the poor lady lay in comfort
and peace in the best bedroom of the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;She seems so grateful to you for having saved
her life,&#8221; Mrs. Fairbanks told Ralph, &#8220;and so
glad, she told me, that her husband had signed
the pledge, that she takes the fire quite reasonably.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; remarked Ralph, &#8220;I heard about the
pledge, and it is a blessed thing. I have other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
grand news, too. There&#8217;s a lot of good fellows
in Stanley Junction, and the Foggs won&#8217;t be long
without a shelter over their heads,&#8221; and Ralph
told his mother all about the subscription list and
the moving picture show benefit.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a grand manager, Ralph,&#8221; said the
fond mother. &#8220;I am only too glad to do my
share in making these people welcome and comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know how to do it, mother,&#8221; declared
Ralph, &#8220;that&#8217;s sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems as if things came about just right to
take in the Foggs,&#8221; spoke Mrs. Fairbanks.
&#8220;Limpy Joe went back to his restaurant on the
Short Line yesterday, and Zeph Dallas has left,
looking for a new job, he says, so we have plenty
of spare rooms for our guests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph started for the ruined Fogg homestead
to see if he could be of any use there. He came
upon Fogg moving some furniture to the barn
of a neighbor on a hand-cart. The fireman
dropped the handles as he saw Ralph. His face
worked with vivid emotion as he grasped the
hand of the young railroader.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what can I say to you
except that you have been the best friend I have
ever known!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, except to make up your mind that
the friendship will last if you want to suit me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest&mdash;honest?&#8221; urged Fogg, the tears in
his eyes, earnestly regarding Ralph&#8217;s face. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t despise me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, we all dislike you, Mr. Fogg!&#8221; railed
Ralph, with a hearty laugh. &#8220;The master mechanic
has such bitter animosity for you, that he&#8217;s
taking his revenge by circulating a subscription
list to help build you a new home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; gasped Fogg, overcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s more,&#8221; proceeded Ralph, in the same
ironical tone, &#8220;the men down at the roundhouse
have such a deep grudge against you, that they
are following his example.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t deserve it&mdash;I don&#8217;t deserve it!&#8221; murmured
the fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, even the new moving picture showman
is so anxious to throw you down, that he&#8217;s going
to give you a benefit Saturday evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;m the wickedest and happiest man
in the world,&#8221; said Fogg, in a subdued tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to be the happiest, after that little
memoranda you gave to the master mechanic,&#8221;
suggested Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pledge? Yes!&#8221; cried the fireman, &#8220;and
I mean to keep it, too. He told you about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And everything else necessary to tell,&#8221; replied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
Ralph. &#8220;It&#8217;s all settled. He says you and I
ought to make a strong team. Let&#8217;s try, hard,
Mr. Fogg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lad, I&#8217;ll show you!&#8221; declared Fogg solemnly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then say no more about it, and let
us get these traps under cover, and get home to
enjoy a famous meal my mother is preparing for
all hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Activity and excitement around the Fairbanks
home did not die down until long after dark. All
the afternoon and evening people came to the
house to see Fogg, to offer sympathy and practical
assistance. If the fireman needed encouragement,
he got plenty of it. He seemed to have
grown into a new man under the chastening,
and yet hopeful influences of that eventful day in
his life. Before his very eyes Ralph fancied he
saw his fireman grow in new manliness, courage
and earnestness of purpose.</p>
<p>All hands were tired enough to sleep soundly
that night. When Ralph came down stairs in the
morning, his mother told him that Fogg was up
and about already. She believed he had gone up
to the ruins to look over things in a general way.
Ralph went out to hunt up the stroller for breakfast.</p>
<p>Scarcely started from the house, he halted
abruptly, for the object of his quest was in view.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
Ralph saw the fireman about half a block away.
He was facing two men whom Ralph recognized
as Hall and Wilson, two blacklisters who had
been prominent in the railroad strike.</p>
<p>One of them was gesticulating vigorously and
telling something to Fogg, while his companion
chipped in a word now and then. Suddenly something
appeared to be said that roused up the fireman.
His hand went up in the air with an angry
menacing motion. He shouted out some words
that Ralph could not hear at the distance he was
from the scene.</p>
<p>The two men seemed to remonstrate. One of
them raised his own fist menacingly. The other
crowded towards Fogg in a stealthy, suspicious
way.</p>
<p>In a flash the climax came. Swinging out his
giant hand, the fireman of No.&nbsp;999 seized his
nearest opponent and gave him a fling into the
ditch. He then sprang at the other, and sent him
whirling head over heels to join his companion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE &#8220;BLACK HAND&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>Lemuel Fogg&#8217;s opponents scrambled to their
feet and sneaked off immediately. The fireman
turned his back upon them, and strode down the
sidewalk in the direction of the Fairbanks&#8217; home
with a stormy and disturbed expression on his
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble, Mr. Fogg?&#8221; intimated the young railroader,
as the fireman approached him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; dissented Fogg vigorously, &#8220;the end of
trouble. I&#8217;m sorry to lose my temper, lad, but
those ruffians were the limit. They know my
sentiments now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were Hall and Wilson, I noticed,&#8221; suggested
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned the fireman, &#8220;and two worse unhung
rascals never walked. They came about you.
Say, Mr. Fairbanks,&#8221; continued Fogg excitedly,
&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t so bad tackling me as a sort of comrade,
considering that I had been foolish enough to
train with them once, but when they mentioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
you&mdash;I went wild. You&mdash;after what you&#8217;ve done
for me and mine! Say&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on&mdash;close the brakes,&#8221; ordered Ralph, as
his companion seemed inclined to run after his
recent adversaries and seek them out for a further
castigation. &#8220;You&#8217;ve made the brake with them&mdash;forget
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They had a new plot to get a black mark
against you,&#8221; went on the fireman. &#8220;I heard
them half through their plans. Then I sailed into
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, breakfast is ready,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;and
after that, work, so we&#8217;d better get down to
schedule.&#8221;</p>
<p>The run to which No.&nbsp;999 had been apportioned
covered the Muddy Creek branch of the Great
Northern to Riverton. The train was an accommodation
and ran sixty miles. It was to leave
Stanley Junction at 9:15 A. M., arrive at terminus
at about noon, and start back for the Junction
at two o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>Ralph left the house about eight o&#8217;clock, after
arranging to meet his fireman at the roundhouse.
He went to the hotel to see Archie Graham, and
found that youthful genius in his room figuring
out some mathematical problem at a table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how are you this morning?&#8221; inquired
Ralph cheerily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;First-rate, except that I&#8217;m a trifle sleepy,&#8221; replied
the young inventor. &#8220;Say, I was riding under
the coaches all night long. It was dream
after dream. I believe it tired me out more than
the real thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t got your new clothes yet, I see,&#8221;
observed Ralph, with a glance at the tattered attire
of his new acquaintance.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are ordered,&#8221; explained Archie, &#8220;but
they won&#8217;t be here until late this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When they do,&#8221; said Ralph, taking a card from
his pocket and writing a few lines on it, &#8220;if you
don&#8217;t want to wait till I have some leisure, take
this to Mr. Forgan, down at the roundhouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Archie.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll extend all the civilities to you. I hope
you may discover something of advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; promised Archie.</p>
<p>Seeing the young inventor, reminded Ralph of
Bridgeport, and naturally he thought of the boy
he had known as Marvin Clark.</p>
<p>&#8220;He telegraphed that he would see me,&#8221;
ruminated Ralph. &#8220;I shall miss him if he comes
to Stanley Junction to-day, but he will probably
wait around for me&mdash;that is, if he comes at all. If
he doesn&#8217;t, in a day or two I shall start some kind
of an investigation as to this strange case of
double identity.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>When Ralph got to the roundhouse he found
Fogg in the doghouse chatting with his friends.
He had to tell the story of the fire over and over
again, it seemed, at each new arrival of an interested
comrade, and Ralph&#8217;s heroic share in the
incident was fully exploited. The young railroader
was overwhelmed by his loyal admirers
with congratulations. Ralph felt glad to compare
the anticipated trip with the starting out on the
first record run of No.&nbsp;999, when he had a half-mad
sullen fireman for a helper.</p>
<p>As the wiper finished his work on the locomotive,
engineer and fireman got into the cab.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; exclaimed Fogg sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; echoed his cabmate.</p>
<p>A little square strip of paper was revealed to
both, as they opened their bunkers. It was patent
that some one had sneaked into the roundhouse
and had pasted the papers there. Each slip bore
a crude outline of a human hand, drawn in pencil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; spoke Fogg, with a brush of a chisel
scraping the portraiture on his own box out of all
semblance, and then doing the same with the
picture on the reverse cover of Ralph&#8217;s bunker.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Fogg?&#8221; inquired the young railroader,
to whom the ominous sketches were a
new wrinkle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Hand,&#8221; explained Fogg.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Whose&mdash;why?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;The outcast gang. It&#8217;s one of their scare
tricks. Humph! I&#8217;d like to get sight of the fellow
who thought he was doing a smart trick.
The Black Hands are supposed to warn us that
we&#8217;re doomed by the gang, see? It&#8217;s a notification
that the trouncing I gave those fellows Hall
and Wilson is a declaration of war to the knife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let it come. Aren&#8217;t we equal to it, Mr.
Fogg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are, for they can&#8217;t hit you hard. You&#8217;ve
made your mark,&#8221; said the fireman, somewhat
gloomily. &#8220;I&#8217;m not in the same class. I&#8217;ve had
my weak spots. Besides, it&#8217;s me they&#8217;ll be after.
Dunno, Fairbanks, maybe I&#8217;d better not be the
cause of getting you into any more trouble. Perhaps
I&#8217;d better slide for a bit into some switchyard
job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&mdash;scared?&#8221; cried Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not scared,&#8221; responded Fogg soberly,
&#8220;only worried about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;the master mechanic said
we were a strong team?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-es.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s prove to him that we are. Good-by to
the Black Hands, Mr. Fogg, they aren&#8217;t worth
thinking about.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the young railroader rallied and cheered his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
comrade, and they had got beyond the turn table
and had quite forgotten the incident of the pasters,
when John Griscom mounted the cab step. He
nodded genially to both Ralph and the fireman.
Griscom knew pretty much what was going on
most of the time, and the master mechanic was
a close friend of his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a word, Fairbanks,&#8221; he began in a confidential
tone, and the young engineer bent over
towards him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be croaking all
the time, but railroading isn&#8217;t all fun and frolic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter now, Mr. Griscom?&#8221; inquired
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old strike gang is the trouble, and will be
until they&#8217;re laid out, ragtail and bobtail, dead
cold. I have a friend in a certain department of
the service here. He isn&#8217;t giving away official
business any, but he isn&#8217;t in sympathy with Hall
or Wilson. One of them sent a wire to Riverton
an hour since. It was to some one the operator
never heard of before, evidently a friend of theirs.
It mentioned&nbsp;999, your name, and Fogg. The
rest of it was in cipher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just had a Black Hand warning, here
in the cab,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you have?&#8221; muttered Griscom. &#8220;Then
there&#8217;s new mischief afoot. Look out for snags
at Riverton.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>Ralph realized that it wasn&#8217;t very pleasant
working under the continual menace of enemies
plotting in the dark and in a mean, desperate way.
There was nothing for it, however, but to exercise
patience, vigilance and courage.</p>
<p>&#8220;They shall never drive me from my post of
duty,&#8221; firmly decided the young railroader. &#8220;I
shall neither tire out nor scare out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Riverton was made on time and with no unpleasant
incident to mar a schedule trip. No.&nbsp;999
was run to a siding, and Ralph and Fogg had over
two hours on their hands to spend as they chose.
They had brought their lunch, and they dispatched
the best part of it in the cab. Mrs. Fairbanks had
put it up in a basket, and a two-quart fruit jar
held the cold coffee. After the repast Fogg fixed
the fire and they strolled down to the depot.</p>
<p>The station agent was an old acquaintance of
Ralph. He knew Van Sherwin, Limpy Joe and
the people up at the Short Line railroad, kept
posted on their progress pretty closely, and he had
a good deal of interesting railroad gossip to retail
to Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, by the way,&#8221; he observed incidentally,
after they had conversed for some time, &#8220;there
was a spruce young fellow here this morning asking
very particularly about&nbsp;999 and her movements.
He mentioned your name too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who was he?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw him before. He was curious all
about your run, hung around a while and then
disappeared. I haven&#8217;t seen him since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Describe him, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; and the station
agent did so. Ralph was sure that the stranger
was the youth he had known as Marvin Clark.
From that time on until the train got ready for
the return trip, the young railroader kept his eyes
open for a glimpse of his acquaintance with the
double identity. The latter, however, up to the
time No.&nbsp;999 steamed out from Riverton, did not
put in an appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, nobody tackled us at Riverton,&#8221; observed
Ralph, as he and Fogg settled down comfortably
to their respective tasks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better not,&#8221; retorted the fireman keenly. &#8220;I
just made a little purchase this morning, and I&#8217;m
going to stand no fooling,&#8221; and he touched his
hip pocket meaningly. &#8220;Have a swig?&#8221; he inquired
additionally, as he reached for the jar of
coffee and took a drink.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I could feast on my mother&#8217;s coffee all
day,&#8221; observed Ralph as the jar was passed to
him. &#8220;Now, then, you finish it up and hand me
one of those doughnuts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little refection seemed to add to the satisfaction
of the moment. Their run was a slow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
one, and there was little to do besides keeping
the machinery in motion. The day was warm,
but the air was balmy. The landscape was interesting,
and they seemed gliding along as in a
pleasing dream.</p>
<p>Later, when he analyzed his sensations, the
young railroader, recalling just these impressions,
knew that they were caused by artificial conditions.
Ralph relapsed into a dream&mdash;indeed, he
was amazed, he was startled to find himself opening
his eyes with difficulty, and of discovering his
fireman doubled up in his seat, fast asleep. He
tried to shout to Fogg, realizing that something
was wrong. He could not utter a word, his
tongue seemed glued to the roof of his mouth.
Ralph barely managed to slip to his feet in an
effort to arouse his cab mate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something wrong!&#8221; ran through his mind.
A vague thrill crossed his frame as, whirling by
a landmark, a white-painted cattle guard, he
realized that he must have gone five miles without
noting distance.</p>
<p>The bridge was his next thought. Muddy
Creek was less than a mile ahead. If the draw
should be open! Wildly reaching towards the
lever, the young engineer sank to the floor a
senseless heap, while No.&nbsp;999, without a guide,
dashed down the shining rails!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A SERIOUS PLOT</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Who stopped this train&mdash;and why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dreamily returning to consciousness, these
were the first words that reached Ralph Fairbanks&#8217;
rallying consciousness. They were spoken
by the conductor of the accommodation train
sharply. The locomotive was at a standstill, and,
staring wonderingly, the conductor stood by the
side of the tender.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; answered a prompt voice, and removing
his hand from the lever, the boy whom the
young engineer had known as Marvin Clark
drifted before his vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; exclaimed the conductor, &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen
you before. You&#8217;re the fellow who caught the
train at Riverton just as she left&mdash;had a free
pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind me, Mr. Conductor,&#8221; responded
the other rapidly. &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking they need some
attention,&#8221; and he pointed to the fireman, lying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
doubled up in his seat, and then to Ralph, lying
prone on the floor of the cab.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks&mdash;Fogg!&#8221; fairly shouted the conductor.
&#8220;Why, what can this mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Foul play, if I&#8217;m a judge,&#8221; spoke Clark definitely.
&#8220;Fairbanks! Fairbanks!&#8221; he shouted,
stooping over and lifting Ralph in his strong
arms. &#8220;Here, brace him in his seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Water!&#8221; gasped the young engineer in a choking
tone. &#8220;My throat is on fire! What has happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing alarming,&#8221; answered Clark reassuringly,
&#8220;only&mdash;I&#8217;m glad I happened to be here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph&#8217;s mouth and throat seemed burning up.
The water he drank only partially allayed his
frantic thirst. It was with great difficulty that
he could arouse himself from a lethargy that
seemed to completely paralyze both body and
mind. As the moments passed, however, he succeeded
in rallying into something like normal.
But as yet he was unable to fully understand just
what had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;He needs something to stimulate him,&#8221; declared
the conductor, and stepping into the cab
he hastily ransacked the fireman&#8217;s bunker.
&#8220;Aha!&#8221;</p>
<p>His tones announced a discovery&mdash;likewise a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
suspicion. He had unearthed two flasks of liquor,
one only partly filled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for me,&#8221; said Ralph, waving back the conductor,
who evidently was intent on administering
a stimulant. &#8220;Liquor!&#8221; he cried, suddenly bracing
up now. &#8220;Fogg never brought it aboard. It&#8217;s
some plot! Why!&#8221; he exclaimed, in sudden enlightenment,
&#8220;I see it all, clear as day.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Ralph saw, all hands in the cab soon
realized within the ensuing ten minutes. When
they had aroused Fogg, there followed animated
theory, discovery and conviction. Not one of
them doubted but that some enemy had sneaked
aboard of the locomotive while it was sidetracked
at noon at Riverton and had put some
drug in the jar of coffee. They found a suspicious
dark sediment at the bottom of the jar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Hands&mdash;mark it down,&#8221; observed Fogg.
&#8220;Whoever did it, also placed those flasks of liquor
in my bunker. See the label on them? They
come from a place in Riverton I never was in.
The scoundrels aimed to have us found in the cab,
just as we have been, and a report go in that the
heat and too much liquor had crippled us from
making the run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve struck it, Fogg,&#8221; assented the conductor.
&#8220;Just stow that jar and those two flasks
in a safe place. I&#8217;ll have our special agent Adair,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
the road detective, find out who bought that liquor.
No need of any blabbing to the general public.
Are you able to complete the run, Fairbanks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; reported Ralph, exercising arms
and feet vigorously to restore their circulation.
Fogg was still dazed and weak. He had drunk
more of the coffee than Ralph. Besides, being
the older of the two, he did not shake off the
effects of the narcotic so readily as the young
engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help fire&mdash;I know how to,&#8221; declared Clark.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know how to stop an engine, too!&#8221; commented
the conductor. &#8220;All right, Fairbanks,
when you&#8217;re ready,&#8221; and he returned to the
coaches. Ralph extended his hand to Clark. The
latter met his glance frankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to get track of your movements
by telegraph,&#8221; said Clark. &#8220;Located your
run, and was waiting at Riverton for your train.
Got there ahead of time, and came back to the
depot just as&nbsp;999 was pulling out, and caught the
last car. First, I thought I&#8217;d not show myself
until you got through with your trip. Things
got dull in those humdrum coaches, though, and
I sailed ahead to the tender, saw what was wrong,
and checked up the locomotive just beyond the
bridge. Say, if the draw had been open, we&#8217;d all
have had a bath, eh?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The miscreants who played this diabolical trick
ought to be severely punished,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>There was no evidence of strained relations between
the two boys. Ralph recognized that Clark
had sought him out to make an explanation. He
wondered what it would be. The present was not,
however, the time to broach the subject. There
was something very manly and reassuring in
Clark&#8217;s manner, and the young railroader believed
that when he got ready to disclose his secret, the
revelation would be an unusual and interesting
one.</p>
<p>The train was started up, soon made up the
lost time, and at 5:15 rolled into the depot at
Stanley Junction. Ralph did not feel quite as well
as usual and his fireman was pale and loggy, but
the main effects of the drug had passed off.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go straight home, Mr. Fogg,&#8221; directed
Ralph. &#8220;I will see that&nbsp;999 is put to bed all
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll take advantage of your kind offer,
Fairbanks,&#8221; responded Fogg. &#8220;I&#8217;m weak as a
cat, and my head is going around like an electric
turntable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fogg started for home. Clark rode with Ralph
on the locomotive to the roundhouse. The big
engine was put into her stall. Then the boys left
the place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have something to say to you, Fairbanks,&#8221;
began Clark.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; replied Ralph. &#8220;It must be
quite a long story, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; admitted his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then suppose we leave its recital till we are
rested a bit,&#8221; suggested Ralph. &#8220;I want you to
come up to the house and have supper. Then
we&#8217;ll adjourn to the garden and have a quiet, comfortable
chat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be famous,&#8221; declared Clark. &#8220;Say,
you don&#8217;t treat an imposter like myself courteous
or anything, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you really an imposter?&#8221; asked Ralph,
with a faint smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am&mdash;and a rank one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just one question&mdash;you are not the real Marvin
Clark?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more than yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you are Fred Porter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; said the young engineer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>&#8220;THE SILVANDOS&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I declare!&#8221; exclaimed Ralph Fairbanks.</p>
<p>&#8220;For mercy&#8217;s sake!&#8221; echoed Fred Porter.</p>
<p>Both stood spellbound just within the grounds
of the Fairbanks&#8217; home, where they had arrived.
Over towards the dividing lot line of the next
door neighbor, their eyes had lit upon an unusual
and interesting scene.</p>
<p>Two figures were in action among the branches
of the great oak tree. They were boys, and their
natural appearance was enough to attract attention.
They were leaping, springing, chasing one
another from branch to branch, with a remarkable
agility that made one think of monkeys and
next trained athletes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are they, anyway?&#8221; demanded Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are new to me,&#8221; confessed the young
engineer.</p>
<p>The two strangers were about of an age, under
sixteen. It would puzzle one to figure out their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
nationality. Their faces were tawny, but delicate
of profile, their forms exquisitely molded. They
suggested Japanese boys. Then Ralph decided
they more resembled lithe Malay children of whom
he had seen photographs. At all events, they were
natural tree climbers. They made the most daring
leaps from frail branches. They sprung from
twigs that broke in their deft grasp, but not until
they had secured the purchase they aimed at in
the act to send them flying through the air to
some other perilous point in view. Their feats
were fairly bewildering, and as one landed on
the ground like a rubber ball and the other chased
him out of sight in the next yard, Ralph conducted
his companion into the house with these words:</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s odd enough to investigate.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not announce his arrival to his mother,
but led Fred up to his room. As he passed that
now occupied by the Foggs, it made his heart glad
to hear the fireman crowing at the baby to the
accompaniment of a happy laugh from the fireman&#8217;s
wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can wash up and tidy up, Porter,&#8221; he said
to his friend. &#8220;I&#8217;ll arrange for an extra plate,
and take you down later to meet the best mother
in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an imposition on you good people,&#8221;
declared Fred, but Ralph would not listen to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
He went downstairs and out the front way, and
came around the house looking all about for some
trace of the two remarkable creatures he had just
seen. They had disappeared, however, as if they
were veritable wood elves. Passing the kitchen
window, the young engineer halted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he uttered. &#8220;Zeph Dallas is back
again,&#8221; and then he listened casually, for Zeph
was speaking to his mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mrs. Fairbanks,&#8221; Ralph caught the
words, &#8220;I&#8217;m the bad penny that turns up regularly,
only I&#8217;ve got some good dollars this time.
On the mantel is the money I owe Ralph for the
clothes he got me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But can you spare the money?&#8221; spoke Mrs.
Fairbanks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I can, and the back board, too,&#8221; declared
Zeph, and glancing in through the open window
Ralph noted the speaker, his fingers in his vest
armholes, strutting around most grandly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand how you came to get so
much money in two days,&#8221; spoke the lady. &#8220;You
couldn&#8217;t have earned it in that short space of time,
Zeph.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; admitted Zeph, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve got it,
haven&#8217;t I? It&#8217;s honest money, Mrs. Fairbanks.
It&#8217;s an advance on my wages&mdash;expense money
and such, don&#8217;t you see?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have secured work, Zeph?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady work, Mrs. Fairbanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What at, Zeph?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Fairbanks,&#8221; answered the lad in a
hushed, mysterious tone of voice, &#8220;I am hired
as a detective.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re what?&#8221; fairly shouted Ralph through
the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! you here, are you?&#8221; cried Zeph, and
in a twinkling he had joined Ralph outside the
house. &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he added, with an important
air that somewhat amused Ralph, &#8220;I&#8217;ve landed
this time. On both feet. Heart&#8217;s desire at last&mdash;I&#8217;m
a detective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph had to smile. He recalled the first arrival
of honest but blundering Zeph Dallas at
Stanley Junction, a raw country bumpkin. Even
then the incipient detective fever had been manifested
by the crude farmer boy. From the confident,
self-assured tone in which Zeph now spoke,
the young railroader was forced to believe that
he had struck something tangible at last in his
favorite line.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you detecting, Zeph?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed&mdash;and what agency are you working
for&mdash;the government?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; observed Zeph gravely, &#8220;is also a secret&mdash;for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
the present. See here, Ralph Fairbanks,
you&#8217;re guying me. You needn&#8217;t. Look at that.&#8221;</p>
<p>With great pride Zeph threw back his coat. It
was to reveal a star pinned to his vest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Ralph, &#8220;I see it, but it doesn&#8217;t
tell who you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t it say &#8216;Special&#8217;?&#8221; demanded Zeph, with
an offended air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I see the word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, that&#8217;s me&mdash;special secret service,
see? Of course, I don&#8217;t look much like a detective,
just common and ordinary now, but I&#8217;m
going to buy a wig and a false beard, and then
you&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Zeph!&#8221; exclaimed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, you keep right on laughing at me,&#8221;
said Zeph. &#8220;All the same, I&#8217;m hired. What&#8217;s
more, I&#8217;m paid. Look at that&mdash;I&#8217;ve got the job
and I&#8217;ve got the goods. That shows something,
I fancy,&#8221; and Zeph waved a really imposing roll
of bank notes before the sight of the young engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your employers must think you a pretty good
man to pay you in advance,&#8221; suggested Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;They do, for a fact,&#8221; declared Zeph. &#8220;They
know they can depend upon me. Say, Ralph, it&#8217;s
funny the way I fell into the job. You never in
your life heard of the slick and easy way I seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
to go rolling right against it. And the mystery,
the deadly secrets, the&mdash;the&mdash;hold on, though, I&#8217;m
violating the eth&mdash;eth&mdash;yes, ethics of the profession.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no&mdash;go on and tell us something about it,&#8221;
urged Ralph. &#8220;I&#8217;m interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve gone too far already. Sworn to
secrecy. Honestly, I&#8217;m not romancing, Ralph,
I&#8217;m working on a case that reads like a story book.
Some of the strange things going on&mdash;they fairly
stagger me. I can&#8217;t say another word just now,
but just the minute I can, you just bet I&#8217;ll tell you
all about it, Ralph Fairbanks. Say, you haven&#8217;t
seen two boys around here, have you&mdash;two tiny
fellows? I left them in the garden here. They&#8217;re
in my charge, and I mustn&#8217;t lose sight of them,&#8221;
and Zeph began looking all around the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two human monkeys, who make no more of
flying through the air than you or I do to run a
race?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s them,&#8221; assented Zeph.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were here a few minutes ago,&#8221; advised
Ralph, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t see them just now. I wondered
who they were. The last I saw of them,
they were chasing one another over our neighbors&#8217;
lot over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must find them,&#8221; said Zeph. &#8220;They are another
of my responsibilities. I hear them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>As Zeph spoke, there proceeded from the alley
a mellow and peculiar but very resonant whistle.
It was followed by a responsive whistle, clear as a
calliope note. Then into view dashed the two
boys for whom Zeph was looking. They were
still chasing one another, and the foremost of the
twain was making for the house. As he passed
a tree full tilt, without the least apparent exertion
he leaped up lightly, seized a branch, coiled
around it like a rubber band, and his pursuer
passed under him at full speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This way, Kara&mdash;hey, Karo,&#8221; called out
Zeph, and the two strange lads came up to him
with a fawn-like docility, in keeping with the
mild, timid expression of their faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sare,&#8221; spoke one of them with a bow, and
his companion repeated the word. They both
bowed to Ralph next, and stood like obedient
children awaiting orders. Ralph was silent for
fully a minute, studying their unfamiliar make-up.
At that moment Fred Porter, having come
down stairs the front way, strolled around the
corner of the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my friend, Fred Porter&mdash;Zeph&mdash;Zeph
Dallas, Porter,&#8221; introduced the young
railroader, and the two boys shook hands. Porter
became instantly interested in the two strange
lads.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to show you fellows something,&#8221;
said Zeph, &#8220;something mighty remarkable, something
you never saw before, and it&#8217;s going to
beat anything you ever heard of. About those
two boys. Kara!&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the two lads instantly moved to the
side of Zeph, who beckoned to him to follow
him. He led the boy ten feet away behind a
thick large bush, his back to the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Karo,&#8221; he spoke again, and the other boy
allowed him to turn him around where he stood,
his back to the other boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Zeph,&#8221; spoke Ralph with a broad
smile, &#8220;are you going to give us a detective
demonstration of some kind, or a sleight-of-hand
demonstration?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quit guying me, Ralph Fairbanks,&#8221; said
Zeph. &#8220;You&#8217;re always at it, but I&#8217;m going to
give you something this time that will make you
sit up and take notice, I&#8217;ll bet. Those boys
came from a good many thousand miles away&mdash;from
the other side of the world, in fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They look it,&#8221; observed Fred Porter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gomera,&#8221; exclaimed Zeph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that now?&#8221; inquired Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the smallest of the Canary Islands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And they talk without saying a word,&#8221; was
Zeph&#8217;s next amazing announcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; commented Fred dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;They do. It&#8217;s that I&#8217;m going to show you.
Perhaps those boys are the only two of their
kind in the United States. They are Silvandos.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are Silvandos, Zeph?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Silvandos,&#8221; replied Zeph, with manifest enjoyment
of the fact that he was making a new
and mystifying disclosure, &#8220;are persons who
carry on a conversation through a whistling
language.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>ZEPH DALLAS AND HIS &#8220;MYSTERY&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Whistling language?&#8221; repeated Fred Porter.
&#8220;Is there one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha! didn&#8217;t I say I was going to show you
something you never heard of before? You bet
there is a whistling language!&#8221; chuckled Zeph&mdash;&#8220;and
I&#8217;m now about to demonstrate it to you.
You see these two boys? Well, they are natives
of Gomera, the smallest of the Canary Islands.
They were raised in a district where at times
there is no living thing within sight, and the vast
wilderness in the winding mountains is broken
only by the crimson flower of the cactus growing
in the clifts of the rock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You talk like a literary showman, Zeph Dallas,&#8221;
declared Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m telling the story as I get it, ain&#8217;t
I?&#8221; demanded Zeph in an injured tone and with
a sharp look at Fred, as if he suspected that he
was being guyed. &#8220;Anyhow, I want to explain
things so you&#8217;ll understand.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go right ahead, Zeph,&#8221; insisted Ralph encouragingly,
&#8220;we&#8217;re interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, up among those big stone terraces is
the whistling race. They are able to converse
with one another at a distance of three miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s pretty strong,&#8221; observed Fred. &#8220;But
make it three miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A Silvando will signal a friend he knows to
be in a certain distant locality. He does it by
setting his fore fingers together at a right angle
in his mouth, just as you&#8217;ll see these two Canaries
do in a minute or two. An arrow of piercing
sounds shoots across the ravine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrow is good&mdash;shoots is good!&#8221; whispered
Fred, nudging Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a moment&#8217;s pause&mdash;&#8221; continued
Zeph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s read all this in some book!&#8221; declared
Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there comes a thin almost uncanny
whistle from far away. Conversation begins,
and as the sounds rise and fall, are shrill or
drawn, so they are echoed. Then comes the
ghostly reply, and then question and answer follows.
They talk&mdash;all right. Travelers say so,
and a lot of scientific fellows are now on the track
of this strange tribe to investigate them before
civilization makes of their talk a dead language.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
Kara&mdash;ready!&#8221; called out Zeph to the boy at the
bush. &#8220;Karo&mdash;attention!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sare,&#8221; answered the little fellow, his bright
twinkling eyes full of intelligence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask him how many!&#8221; said Zeph &#8220;&mdash;see?&#8221;
and he touched himself, the boy and Ralph and
Fred with his forefinger in turn.</p>
<p>Out rang a series of rising interrogatory
sounds. There was a pause. Then from the
boy stationed at the bush came quick responsive
toots&mdash;one, two, three, four.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Kara to bring you this&mdash;see, this?&#8221; and
Zeph stooped down and touched the sodded yard
with his hand. Karo whistled again. Immediately
Kara wheeled, stooped also, and was at their
side in an instant, tendering a handful of grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, this is odd all right,&#8221; confessed Fred
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Kara to climb a tree next,&#8221; spoke Zeph.
More &#8220;whistle talk,&#8221; and agile as a monkey Kara
was aloft, making dizzying whirls among the
branches of an oak nearby. &#8220;I tell you, it would
stun you to watch these little fellows at play. It&#8217;s
like a piccolo or a calliope to hear them talk&mdash;yes,
sir, talking just as knowingly as we do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are they, anyway?&#8221; spoke Fred
curiously?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you&mdash;Canaries.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but where did you pick them up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a secret. You see,&#8221; responded Zeph,
looking duly wise and mysterious, &#8220;those boys
were imported to this country by a peculiar old
man, who wanted servants around him who
weren&#8217;t gabbing about his affairs and asking him
questions all the time. Well, he&#8217;s got them,
hasn&#8217;t he? I&#8217;m working for that man, or rather
for a friend of his. Detective work,&#8221; continued
Zeph, rather proudly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told Ralph. These
two boys have been shut up in the house for two
months. They just pined for fresh air, and
trees&mdash;oh! trees are their stronghold. When I
started out with them they made for the first tree
like birds for a roost. I have taken them out for
an airing, and I ran down here to report to Ralph
how I was getting on, and brought them along
with me for the novelty of the thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they live near here?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Zeph, &#8220;we had to come by rail.
I can&#8217;t tell you where they live, but it&#8217;s on a
branch of the Great Northern. I&#8217;ve got to get
back to-night. We&#8217;ve had our supper, Ralph.
I just wanted to settle up the bills I owed you.
I&#8217;ll say good-bye to your mother and get to the
depot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeph and his charges trooped to the kitchen
door. Zeph spoke a few words to Mrs. Fairbanks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
His companions bowed her a polite and
graceful adieu, and Ralph accompanied their
former boarder to the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Ralph,&#8221; said Zeph to the young
engineer in parting, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to think
I wouldn&#8217;t tell you everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Zeph.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But honestly, I&#8217;ve solemnly agreed not to
lisp a word about what I am really about or the
people concerned in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, too,&#8221; declared Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say this, though,&#8221; resumed Zeph: &#8220;I&#8217;m
working on a strange and serious case. It&#8217;s no
play or fooling. I&#8217;m getting big pay. I may do
a big thing in the end, and when I do, if I do,
I&#8217;m coming straight to tell you all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph watched Zeph and his charges disappear
down the street with a great deal of curiosity and
wonderment in his mind. A great many lively
and unusual incidents were coming to the front
recently, but this one was certainly enough out
of the ordinary to give him food for profound
thought.</p>
<p>Ralph rejoined Fred in the garden, and took
him into the house and introduced him to his
mother. Mrs. Fairbanks won the heart of the
manly young fellow, as she did the love of all of
her son&#8217;s friends.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>It was a pleasant, happy little coterie, that
which sat down at the table soon afterwards to
enjoy one of Mrs. Fairbanks&#8217; famous meals.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed!&#8221; declared Fred, after his seventh
hot biscuit with freshly churned butter that
made his mouth water, &#8220;but eating houses and
hotels, Mrs. Fairbanks, make a roving, homeless
fellow like me desperate, and if a third helping
of that exquisite apple sauce isn&#8217;t out of order,
I&#8217;ll have another small fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m spoiled for regular cooking, Bessie,&#8221; declared
Fogg to his wife. &#8220;Mrs. Fairbanks is
fattening us till we&#8217;ll be of no use at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are all flatterers,&#8221; said Mrs. Fairbanks
warningly, but with a pleased smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take another piece of cake, ma&#8217;am, providing
you&#8217;ll promise me the little exercise of
helping you wash the dishes afterwards,&#8221; spoke
Fred.</p>
<p>He interested the widow with his animated,
interested talk as he bustled around the kitchen,
wearing a big apron while drying the dishes.
Then when this task was completed, he and Ralph
went out to the little summer house and comfortably
seated themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; remarked the young railroader
with a pleasant smile, &#8220;now for your confession,
Fred.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; objected his comrade vociferously,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve done nothing that&#8217;s wrong to confess. It
will be an explanation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Ralph, &#8220;open the throttle
and start the train.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment there was an interruption. A
chubby, undersized boy came swiftly through the
gateway. He was advancing up the steps of the
house when Ralph halted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, there, Davis!&#8221; he challenged. &#8220;What&#8217;s
wanted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you there, Fairbanks!&#8221; responded Ned
Davis, the red-headed call boy for the roundhouse
of the Great Northern, familiarly known as
&#8220;Torchy.&#8221; &#8220;Extra orders for you and Fogg&mdash;you&#8217;re
to take out a special to-night.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>IN WIDENER&#8217;S GAP</h3>
</div>
<p>There was always a spice of novelty and
excitement for the young engineer in running a
special. Besides that, extra orders meant pay and
a half, sometimes double pay, with twenty-four
hours&#8217; rest after it, if the special run came after
midnight.</p>
<p>Ralph arose from his seat in the summer-house,
telling Ned Davis that Fogg and himself would
report at the roundhouse at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to excuse me, Porter,&#8221; he said to
his guest. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to postpone our talk until
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Duty call, I see,&#8221; returned Fred. &#8220;Well,
there&#8217;s no urgency, now that I&#8217;ve found out you
don&#8217;t consider me some hideous impostor of the
old story book kind. I&#8217;ll go as far with you as
a hotel, and tell you what I have to say after this
trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll camp right here at the Fairbanks cottage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
until I return,&#8221; peremptorily declared Ralph.
&#8220;My mother would be lonesome if there wasn&#8217;t a
boy somewhere about the house. Zeph is gone
and my other friends, and you will be good
company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only too willing, if it&#8217;s entirely agreeable,&#8221;
said Fred, and so it was settled.</p>
<p>Fogg grumbled a good deal when Ralph told
him of the extra call. He declared that he had
just succeeded in teaching the baby to say &#8220;All
aboard!&#8221; looked at the sky and predicted the
biggest storm of the season, and was cross generally
until he climbed aboard No.&nbsp;999. Then
Ralph heard him talking to the well-groomed
steel steed as if it was some pet racer, and he
anxious and glad to put it through its paces.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the run, Fairbanks?&#8221; asked the fireman,
as Ralph returned from the roundhouse
office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing very interesting. Special sleeper,
some convention crowd for Bridgeport, came in
on the north branch. We&#8217;ve got to pick our way
on our own schedule.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! thought it must be a treasure train, or
the pay car at the least!&#8221; snorted Fogg contemptuously,
but thoroughly good-natured under the
surface.</p>
<p>When they backed down to the depot, Ralph
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
was handed his flimsy orders. No.&nbsp;999 was given
standard special lights, with the usual markers at
the rear of the sleeping car, but no one on platform
charge. The coach had a conductor, but he
barely showed himself, and went inside, where
all the curtains were drawn and passengers evidently
gone to sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you it was going to rain,&#8221; spoke Fogg,
as they cleared the limits and got ready for a
spurt. &#8220;All schedule cancelled where we can get
clear tracks, I suppose? All right, let&#8217;s see what
999 can do on slippery rails.&#8221;</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;999 did famously, as she always did under
the guidance of the vigilant young engineer.
Ralph was learning a good deal lately, and his
mind was always strictly on the business of the
moment when at the throttle. He was learning
that there was a science in running a locomotive a
good deal deeper than merely operating throttle,
brake and lever automatically. There was a way
to conserve the steam energy and reserve wide-open
tactics for full pressure that he had found
out, which enabled him to spurt when the chance
came, at no cost of exhaustion later. He knew
the gauges by heart, how to utilize the exhaust,
and worked something along the line of the new
superheated steam theory.</p>
<p>The night had set in very dark and very stormy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
They had nothing to look out for, however, on
the out track except an accommodation that had
started two hours previous. No.&nbsp;999 had a light
load, and she sped along without a jar. The
wires took care of her. By nine o&#8217;clock they were
twenty miles &#8220;to the good&#8221; on regular schedule
basis.</p>
<p>After that it was slower progress. The wind
had arisen to a hurricane, the rain came down in
torrents, and as they passed Winston they began
to get in among the hills, where there was a series
of intricate and dangerous curves.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nearly a waterspout,&#8221; observed Fogg, as
the rain swept against the cab as if driven from a
full pressure hose, and they could feel the staunch
locomotive quiver as it breasted great sweeps of
the wind. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like that,&#8221; he muttered, as a
great clump came against the cab curtain. And he
and his engineer both knew what it was from past
experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of those young landslides,&#8221; spoke Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;The second in a half-an-hour,&#8221; declared Fogg.
&#8220;It&#8217;s clear mud, but sometime in one of these
storms we&#8217;ll get a big drop of rock, and there&#8217;ll
be mischief afoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph slowed as they entered a long stretch
known as Widener&#8217;s Gap. It was a pull up hill.
Besides that, Widener was only two miles ahead,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
and the curves were so sharp and frequent that
they could not catch the semaphore at any
distance.</p>
<p>Both engineer and fireman were under an
intense strain, and Ralph kept a keen lookout
from his cab window. Fogg was doing the same.
Suddenly he uttered a great shout. It was echoed
by Ralph, for there was cause for excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;A tree!&#8221; yelled Fogg.</p>
<p>Ralph set the air and pulled the lever in a
flash. What the gleaming headlight of No.&nbsp;999
had shown, however, they were upon in a leap.
They could feel a grinding jar, but the pilot had
evidently swept the obstacle aside. They could
hear the branches sweep the top of the engine.
Then there came a warning sound.</p>
<p>Bumpety-bump,-bump-bump! The tree, uprooted
from the gap side by the rain and the
wind, had descried half a circle, it seemed, when
shifted by the pilot. Its big end had rolled under
the coach. From the feeling the young engineer
could guess what had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut her off!&#8221; shouted Fogg.</p>
<p>&#8220;The coach has jumped the track!&#8221; echoed
Ralph quickly.</p>
<p>His heart was in his mouth as he made every
exertion to bring the locomotive to a quick stop.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
No.&nbsp;999 acted splendidly, but it was impossible to
slow down under two hundred feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both trucks off&mdash;she&#8217;s toppling!&#8221; yelled Fogg,
with a backward glance.</p>
<p>Each instant Ralph waited for the crash that
would announce a catastrophe. It did not come.
The coach swayed and careened, pounding the
sleepers set on a sharp angle and tugging to part
the bumpers. Ralph closed the throttle and took
a glance backwards for the first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The coach is safe, Mr. Fogg,&#8221; he spoke.
&#8220;Get back and see how badly the passengers are
mixed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing coming behind us?&#8221; asked the
fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but tell the conductor to set the light back
as far as he can run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Allright.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Night Express!&#8221; gasped Ralph the next
moment, in a hushed whisper, as he caught the
faint echo of a signal whistle ahead of them in
the distance.</p>
<p>An alarming thought came into his mind.
Nothing could menace them ahead on the out
track and nothing was due behind, but the coach
attached to No.&nbsp;999 stood on a tilt clear across
the in track.</p>
<p>Along those rails in ten minutes&#8217; time, unaware
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
of the obstruction, the night express would come
thundering down the grade at a forty-mile clip
around the sharp curves of Widener&#8217;s Gap.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s 38. She&#8217;s due, entering Widener,&#8221;
breathed Ralph. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; with a glance at the cab
clock, &#8220;and just on time. Mr. Fogg,&#8221; he shouted
after his fireman, leaping to the ground, &#8220;get the
people out of that coach&mdash;38 is coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Night Express,&#8221; cried Fogg hoarsely. &#8220;I
never thought of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph tore one of the rear red tender lights
from its place. He started down the out rails on
a dead run. His only hope now was of reaching
the straight open stretch past the last curve in
open view of Widener. To set the warning signal
short of that would be of no avail. No. 38
could not possibly see it in time, coming at full
speed, to avoid a smash-up.</p>
<p>In a single minute the young engineer was
drenched to the skin. It was all that he could do
to keep from being blown from his footing. He
fairly counted the seconds as he shot forward,
sprinting to the limit on that slippery, flooded
roadbed. He could not restrain a shout of relief
and hope as he turned the last curve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Widener&mdash;38!&#8221; he gasped.</p>
<p>The station lamps were visible, a mile distant.
Somewhat nearer, a blur of white radiance amid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
the dashing rain, was the headlight of No. 38
showing that she was coming at momentarily increasing
speed. Ralph aimed to run nearer to the
air line stretch to plant the signal. Suddenly his
feet tripped and he went headlong. The breath
seemed knocked out of his body as he landed
across the ties of the brief trestle reach, which he
had forgotten all about in his excitement. The
lantern, flung wide from his grasp, struck one rail,
smashed to pieces, and the lamp went out as it
dropped with a flare into the deep gully beneath.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>AT THE SEMAPHORE</h3>
</div>
<p>THE young engineer of No.&nbsp;999 struggled to
his feet appalled. The case seemed hopeless. He
had matches in his pocket. In dry weather under
the same circumstances he might to gather up
enough dry grass and brush to build a fire between
the rails, but now, with everything soaked and
dripping this was impossible.</p>
<p>&#8220;The semaphore signal!&#8221; gasped Ralph. &#8220;Can
I reach it in time?&#8221;</p>
<p>He crossed the remainder of the trestle in desperate
leaps. Ralph calculated the distance to the
semaphore, the distance of the train, and his heart
failed him. Still he kept on. His eyes were fixed
on the lantern aloft showing open tracks for the
oncoming train. It was his star of hope. Then
as he reached it he saw that he was too late.</p>
<p>To scale the slippery timber to the staple-runners
without boot hooks would be no easy task.
To get to the first rung and ascend would consume
fully two minutes&#8217; time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I do&mdash;what can I do?&#8221; panted
the young railroader in desperation.</p>
<p>Just beyond the semaphore was a symmetrical
heap of bleached blocks of rock comprising a
landmark guide for engineers. Ralph ran to it.
Groping among the gravel at its base, his fingers
frantically grasped several loose stones. He
glanced once at the glowering headlight of No. 38.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can make it&mdash;if I can only make it!&#8221; he
voiced, and the aspiration was a kind of a wail.</p>
<p>The young engineer of No.&nbsp;999 had been the
former leader of all boyish sports and exercises
in Stanley Junction. Posed as he had posed many
times in the past when he was firing at a mark,
with all his skill, he calculated aim, distance and
fling. The bull&#8217;s eye target was the lantern pendant
from the arm of the semaphore.</p>
<p>One&mdash;failed! the missile missed its intended
mark.</p>
<p>Two&mdash;a ringing yell of delight, of hope, of triumph
rang from the lips of the young engineer.
The skillfully-aimed projectile had struck the
glass of the signal, shivering it to atoms. The
wind and rain did the rest. Out went the light.</p>
<p>A sharp whistle from No. 38, the hiss of the air
brakes, and panting and exhausted, the young
engineer of No.&nbsp;999 watched the Night Express
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
whiz by on a lessening run and come to a stop
two hundred yards away.</p>
<p>Ralph dashed after the train, now halted
beyond the trestle. He did not heed the shout
of the brakeman already out on the tracks, but
got up to the locomotive just as the conductor,
lantern in hand, reached it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; shot out the engineer of No. 38, staring
at the figure outlined within the halo of the
conductor&#8217;s light&mdash;&#8220;Fairbanks!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, so it is!&#8221; exclaimed the conductor, and
it was easy for him to discern from Ralph&#8217;s sudden
appearance and breathless manner that he had
some interest, if not an active part, in the mysterious
disappearance of the semaphore signal.
&#8220;What is it, Fairbanks?&#8221;</p>
<p>Very hurriedly Ralph explained. The engineer
of No. 38 uttered a low whistle, meantime
regarding the active young railroader, whom he
well knew, with a glance of decided admiration.
Then as hurried were the further movements of
the conductor.</p>
<p>Within a very few minutes a brakeman was
speeding back to Widener to inform the man on
duty there of the condition of affairs. He
returned to report the situation in safe official
control all up and down the line. In the meantime
No 38. had moved up to the scene of the wreck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
This was done at the suggestion of Ralph, who
did not know how the passengers in the special
coach might have fared. Arrived at the scene,
however, it was soon learned that two men only
had been thrown from their beds and slightly
bruised. The rest of the passengers were only
shaken up.</p>
<p>The frightened passengers were huddled up,
drenched to the skin, at the side of the gap, for
Fogg had insisted on their taking no risk remaining
in the derailed coach.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re stalled for three hours,&#8221; decided the
engineer of No. 38.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and more than that, if the wrecking gang
is not at Virden, as we suppose,&#8221; added the
conductor.</p>
<p>The passengers of the derailed coach were
taken to shelter in a coach which backed to
Widener. There was nothing to do now for the
engineer and fireman of No.&nbsp;999 but to await the
arrival of the wrecking crew. Word came finally
by messenger from the dispatcher at the station
that the same was on its way to the Gap. Inside
of two hours the coach was back on the rails, and
No.&nbsp;999 moved ahead, took on transferred passengers
from No. 38, and renewed the run to Bridgeport
on a make-time schedule.</p>
<p>There had been a good many compliments for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
the young engineer from the crew of No. 38. The
conductor had expressed some gratifying expressions
of appreciation from the passengers who
had heard of Ralph&#8217;s thrilling feat at the semaphore.
The conductor of the special coach
attached to No.&nbsp;999 had come up and shook hands
with Ralph, a choking hoarseness in his throat as
he remarked: &#8220;It&#8217;s a honor to railroad with such
fellows as you.&#8221; Fogg had said little. There
were many grim realities in railroading he knew
well from experience. This was only one of
them. After they started from Widener he had
given his engineer a hearty slap of the shoulder,
and with shining eyes made the remark:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is another boost for you, Fairbanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For No.&nbsp;999, you mean,&#8221; smiled Ralph significantly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll hope so, anyway, Mr. Fogg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wet, grimed, cinder-eyed, but supremely satisfied,
they pulled into Bridgeport with a good record,
considering the delay at the Gap. The conductor
of the special coach laid off there. No.&nbsp;999
was to get back to Stanley Junction as best she
could and as quickly. As she cut loose from the
coach its conductor came up with an envelope.</p>
<p>&#8220;My passengers made up a little donation, Fairbanks,&#8221;
the man said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a newspaper man
among them. He&#8217;s correspondent for some daily
press association. Been writing up &#8216;the heroic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
dash&mdash;brave youth at the trestle&mdash;forlorn hope of
an unerring marksman&#8217;&mdash;and all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s not writing for a newspaper,&#8221;
laughed Ralph; &#8220;he&#8217;s making up a melodrama.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;ll make you famous, just the same,
and here&#8217;s some government photographs for you
lucky fellows,&#8221; added the conductor, tossing the
envelope in his hand into the cab.</p>
<p>Fogg grinned over his share of the fifty-dollar
donation and accepted it as a matter of course.
Ralph said nothing, but he was somewhat
affected. He was pleased at the recognition of
his earnest services. At the same time the exploit
of the night had shaken his nerves naturally, and
reminded him of all the perils that accompanied
a practical railroad career. A stern sense of
responsibility made him thoughtful and grave,
and he had in mind many a brave, loyal fellow
whose fame had been unheralded and unsung,
who had stuck to his post in time of danger and
had given up his life to save others.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;999 was back at Stanley Junction by eight
o&#8217;clock the next morning. When Ralph reached
home he was so tired out he did not even wait for
breakfast, but went straightway to his bed.</p>
<p>He came down the stairs in the morning bright
as a dollar, to hear his mother humming a happy
song in the dining-room, and Fred Porter softly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
accompanying with a low-toned whistle on the
veranda. The latter, waving a newspaper in his
hand, made a dash for Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; he exclaimed, pointing to some sensational
headlines. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got you in print with
a vengeance. A whole column about &#8216;the last
heroic exploit of our expert young railroader and
rising townsman&mdash;Engineer Fairbanks.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XIX_THE_BOY_WHO_WAS_HAZED' id='CHAPTER_XIX_THE_BOY_WHO_WAS_HAZED'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE BOY WHO WAS HAZED</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Well, Porter, proceed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph gave the direction. He and Fred were
seated in the garden summer-house, settled comfortably
on benches facing each other across a
rustic table, after a good breakfast, a general restful
feeling permeating them.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented Fred. &#8220;Before I begin,
though, I wish to make a remark. The way your
mother and yourself have treated me has been just
royal&mdash;I&#8217;ll never forget it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And never forget us,&#8221; directed the young
engineer with a warm, friendly smile. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
always find yourself welcome in this house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what gets me,&#8221; said Fred, and there
was a slight tremor and a suspicion of tears in his
voice. &#8220;Most fellows would have little to do with
an impostor, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a pretty hard word, Porter,&#8221; intimated
Ralph. &#8220;Just the same, I believe in you. I have
had confidence in you all along.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And my story won&#8217;t disturb it any,&#8221; declared
Fred. &#8220;Well, to begin&mdash;my name is not Marvin
Clark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I know that already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Fred Porter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you have told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am an orphan, homeless. As I said when
I first came here, I have been a sort of a knockabout,
a wanderer. I have been a poor boy. The
real Marvin Clark, whose father is the real and
genuine president of the Middletown &amp; Western
Railroad, is a rich boy. I have saved his life
when he was drowning. He likes me for that,
and there isn&#8217;t much that he wouldn&#8217;t do for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You deserve it,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to make a long story short, he was a
student at the Earlville Academy. He&#8217;s a fine,
manly fellow, nothing sneaking or mean about
him. One night, though, he and his school chums
got to cutting up. They raided the town and had
a dozen fights with the village boys. One of them
was taken prisoner, a lad named Ernest Gregg.
The academy fellows decided to haze him. They
put him through an awful course of sprouts.
They ducked him in the river, scared him with
mock gunpowder explosions, and wound up by
tying him blindfolded to a switch near a railroad
track. They left him there all night. The result
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
was that when little Ernest was discovered the
next morning, he was in a high fever and
delirious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad,&#8221; murmured Ralph. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
much of your Marvin Clark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, don&#8217;t misjudge him. He helped to
capture the enemy, as they called poor little
Gregg, but he left the crowd right after that, supposing
his chums would scare their captive a bit
and let him go. Clark had no hand whatever in
the downright persecution that sent the boy to
the hospital. It seems that some of the gunpowder
got into the eyes of the little fellow, and the
douse in the river had given him a cold. The
scare he got had nearly driven him out of his right
mind, for he was a timid little fellow. A month
later Ernest was discharged from the hospital
nearly blind, thin, pale and weakly, a mere
shadow of his former self.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course the academy fellows tried to make
up for all that,&#8221; suggested Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t. Vacation came on, and they hied
to their homes with not a thought of the great
sorrow they had brought on their innocent victim.
They say that Clark was just furious when he
heard of it all. He laid out two of the ringleaders
and shamed them in public. He sought out
Ernest and took him to the best hotel in town.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
He hired doctors, and loaded the little fellow with
comforts and luxuries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have cost him something,&#8221; remarked
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did Clark care for that? His father
was rich and gave him all the money he wanted.
He had an account at a bank, and was heir to
two aunts who doated on him and who were fabulously
rich. I never saw a fellow take to heart
the misfortunes of a poor little stranger as Clark
did. The incident seemed to have changed his
whole life. He sobered down wonderfully. He
blamed himself for the whole thing, and took the
whole responsibilities upon himself. Nearly all
the time he was with Ernest, trying to cheer him
up, hoping to find some way to make him well and
strong and happy again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A royal good fellow, in fact, just as you said&mdash;I
see that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; declared Fred staunchly. &#8220;Well, to
continue: Clark&#8217;s father and family were going
to Europe. They had arranged for young Clark
to go with them, but he wouldn&#8217;t. Then there was
a family council. Clark had not made much progress
at school. He was fine at football, but no
good at arithmetic. In fact, he was a disappointment
to his father as a student. The old man, the
academy professor, and the family lawyer, held a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
great consultation. Old man Clark came to a
stern decision. It was planned out that young
Clark should follow in the footsteps of his father
and become a railroader. A regular arrangement
was made. Clark was to have free passes everywhere.
He was to spend his entire vacation traveling
over different railroad systems, while his
folks were in Europe. Twice a week he was to
send to the family lawyer reports of his progress,
accompanied by vouchers showing that he had not
wasted the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; nodded Ralph; &#8220;also where you come
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s easy to guess,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;Just
at that time I happened to be on a flying visit to
Earlville, where one day I met Clark. He took
me to the hotel, where I met Ernest. I had
known young Gregg before, for he had come to
Earlville a ragged, homeless lad before I first
left, seeming to have no home or relatives, and
going to work at odd jobs around the town. Clark
told me of the fix he was in. While we were talking,
a sudden idea came to him. He became very
much excited and serious, and then made a very
strange request of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To assume his identity and go railroading in
his stead?&#8221; inquired Ralph, anticipating what was
coming.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve struck it,&#8221; assented Fred; &#8220;just that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you accepted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is why you see me here,&#8221; said Fred.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t think any the less of me, Fairbanks, for
doing it. Don&#8217;t find fault with me if I took up
the imposture for all there was in it. It&#8217;s my way&mdash;when
I go at a thing, I do so with all my&mdash;nerves.
I was Marvin Clark to the core. I took
up his name, I played his part, and say, I tried
not to disgrace his good name by one unmanly act.
He taught me to imitate his handwriting perfectly
one day. The next I was on the road, without a
mishap until I met you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which may not be a mishap after all,&#8221; suggested
the young engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think as you do about that. I&#8217;ve come to
you for advice, and I feel sure that it will be good
advice. Now, then, to get to central motive of
Clark&#8217;s plan&mdash;a noble, grand act, a royal deed.
It was all for the sake of his little charge, Ernest
Gregg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can imagine that,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clark could not get the little fellow out of his
mind. He had got, it seemed, a clew to some of
his relatives. He told me that only for a wicked
enemy, and if he had his rights, Ernest would be
in a position of positive wealth. He said that he
was determined to find a certain old man who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
could clear up the whole situation. He was going
to start out with Ernest to solve the secret of his
strange life, while his friends supposed that he
was following out the plan that his father had arranged.
Clark made a plan how we were to keep
track of one another, writing to certain points
we agreed upon. I started out from Earlville on
my part of the arrangement, while Clark stole out
of town with his young charge. For three weeks
I wrote regularly to him and he replied. During
the last month I have not received a word from
him, and some of my letters have come back to
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are worried about him?&#8221; inquired
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, very much. You see, he spoke of an
enemy of Ernest. How do I know what may
have happened to both of them? If Clark should
disappear, see what a fix I am in, assuming his
name, spending his money. I&#8217;d have a hard time
explaining reasonably the wild, mad move Clark
made me take.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is certainly a singular situation,&#8221; admitted
the young railroader thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it, now? I&#8217;ve come to you to have you
help me solve the problem. Think it over, give
me some advice. Or, one thing&mdash;you go to many
places with your railroading. You might keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
a watch out for Clark, just as I am doing. You
might get a clew to him or run across him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how should I know him?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to give you his picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred drew out a memorandum book and
selected from it a small photograph, which he presented
to Ralph. The latter saw a bright, manly
face portrayed in the picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;You keep that,&#8221; directed Fred.</p>
<p>Ralph reflected for a few moments. Then they
discussed the situation in all its bearings. There
was not much to suggest, however, on the part
of the young engineer. The most they could hope
for, he told Fred, was that one or the other of
them might by some circumstance run across the
missing Clark and his young charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got an idea that I ought to run down a
branch line of the road I have never been over,&#8221;
suggested Fred, at the close of their animated colloquy.
&#8220;If I do, I&#8217;ll have to catch a train in an
hour. I&#8217;ll get word to you soon again, and if you
hear of anything that interests me, I&#8217;ll arrange
so that a letter or a wire will reach me if you
address it to Marvin Clark, Lake Hotel,
Wellsville.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Ralph.</p>
<p>They strolled together down to the depot a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
after that. A train from the west came in just
as the one having Fred for a passenger steamed
out. A familiar figure alighted from one of the
coaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I am again,&#8221; announced Zeph Dallas,
coming up to Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are your little friends, the Canaries?&#8221;
inquired the young engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Safe and snug at home,&#8221; replied Zeph.
&#8220;Going up to the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, just come in from a special trip, and I
probably have a lay-over till to-morrow. I want
to call and see a friend at the hotel for a few
moments. Then I&#8217;m at your service.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they reached the hotel, Ralph sought out
Archie Graham, to find the young inventor in his
room, engrossed in putting together some kind of
a mechanical model. The latter greeted Ralph
with effusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m having the prime chance of my life,&#8221;
declared Archie. &#8220;That note of yours was the
open sesame to the roundhouse and everything
about it. The foreman made me as welcome as
a friend. I say, Fairbanks, they think a lot of
you, these railroad chums of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they?&#8221; asked Ralph, with a modest smile.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you results in a few days,&#8221; declared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
Archie, with a show of more enthusiasm than
Ralph had ever before seen him exhibit. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got up an invention that will just about revolutionize
engineering.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do. Only a day or two, and I&#8217;m going
to try it&mdash;you&#8217;ll hear about it, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph did, in fact, hear about it in a very sensational
way, and within a few hours after the
interview.</p>
<p>He rejoined Zeph and they proceeded homewards.
Zeph was just as mysterious as ever
about his new employment. Ralph knew that he
was bubbling over from a pent-up lot of secrecy,
but he did not encourage his quaint friend to violate
an evident confidence reposed in him by his
employer.</p>
<p>Zeph announced that he would like to stay over
at the Fairbanks home until the next day, and was
made duly welcome. He amazed and amused
Ralph by showing him his &#8220;detective outfit,&#8221; as
he called it. It was an incongruous mass, stored
away in a flat leather case that he secreted in a
great pocket made inside his coat&mdash;a wig, false
whiskers, a pair of goggles, and a lot of other
&#8220;secret service&#8221; paraphernalia, suggested to Zeph
by reading some cheap and sensational detective
stories.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got to get on the shadowy trail
to-day,&#8221; yawned Zeph, as he got out of bed the
next morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the shadow, Zeph?&#8221; asked Ralph
humorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let you know when I find my quarry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, bad as that?&#8221; laughed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you can smile, Ralph Fairbanks,&#8221; said
Zeph resentfully. &#8220;I tell you, I&#8217;m on a mighty
important case and&mdash;say, where did you get
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That picture!&#8221; exclaimed Zeph, picking up
from the bureau the photograph of Marvin Clark,
given to the young engineer by Fred Porter the
day previous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that picture?&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;A friend of
mine gave it to me. He&#8217;s trying to find its original,
and hoped I could help him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trying to find him?&#8221; repeated Zeph with big
staring eyes. &#8220;Whew! I can do that for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can?&#8221; demanded Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know the original of that picture
then?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I do&mdash;why, he&#8217;s the person who hired
me to be a detective,&#8221; was Zeph&#8217;s remarkable
reply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>&#8220;LORD LIONEL MONTAGUE&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get on here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got a paus, don&#8217;t you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paws? Yes, I see,&#8221; said Lemuel Fogg.
&#8220;Take &#8217;em off the tender, son, or you&#8217;ll get a jerk
that will land you, for we&#8217;re going to start up
pretty soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hawdly&mdash;I have a right here, my man&mdash;I&#8217;ve
got a paus, don&#8217;t you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, my friend, if you are bound for
Hadley, this isn&#8217;t the train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say Hadley, sir, I said &#8216;hawdly.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He means hardly, Mr. Fogg,&#8221; put in Ralph,
&#8220;and he is trying to tell you he has a pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t he talk English, then?&#8221; demanded
the fireman of No.&nbsp;999 contemptuously, while the
person who had aroused his dislike looked indignant
and affronted, and now, extending a card to
Ralph, climbed up into the tender.</p>
<p>He was a stranger to the engineer&mdash;a man
Ralph could not remember having seen before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
His attire was that of a conventional tourist, and
his face, words and bearing suggested the conventional
foreigner. He wore a short, stubby black
mustache and side whiskers, a monocle in one
eye, and he had a vacuous expression on his face
as of a person of immense profundity and &#8220;class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph, glancing over the card, saw that it was a
pass from the master mechanic of the road, briefly
explaining that the bearer was Lord Lionel Montague,
studying up American railroad systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t offer you a seat, Lord Montague,&#8221;
spoke Ralph politely. &#8220;It&#8217;s rough work in
cramped quarters aboard a locomotive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have noticed it,&#8221; replied &#8220;his ludship.&#8221; &#8220;Not
so abroad, by no means, my man. In fact, on the
home lines in Lunnon, it is quite the thing, you
know, for the quality to make a fad of locomotive
parties, and the accommodations for their comfort
are quite superior to this, don&#8217;t you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That so?&#8221; growled Fogg, with an unpleasant
glance at the stranger. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve had Senators
in my cab in my time, glad to chum with the crew
and set back on the coal, jolly and homelike as
could be&mdash;as you&#8217;ll have to do, if you stay on this
engine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Remawkably detestable person!&#8221; observed the
stranger confidentially to Ralph. &#8220;I shall ride
only a short distance&mdash;to the first stop, in fact.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are welcome,&#8221; replied Ralph, &#8220;and if I
can explain anything to you, I am at your
service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thawnks, thawnks,&#8221; uttered the pretentious
passenger, and fixed his monocled eye on space
in a vapid way.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;999 was on schedule for the old accommodation
run to Riverton. It was nearly a week
after the interview between the young engineer
and Fred Porter recited in the last chapter.
Affairs had quited down with Ralph, and railroad
life had settled down to ordinary routine
of the usual commonplace character.</p>
<p>There had at first been considerable interest for
Ralph in the remarkable statement of Zeph Dallas
that the original of the photograph of Marvin
Clark, the son of the railroad president, was his
mysterious employer. Further than that involuntary
admission of his erratic friend, however,
Ralph could not persuade Zeph to go. Zeph
declared that he was bound by a compact of the
greatest secrecy. He insisted that there could be
no possibility of a mistake in his recognition of
the picture.</p>
<p>Ralph told him that a friend was very anxious
to find his employer, and told Zeph who his friend
was. The latter became serious, and acted quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
disturbed when he learned that it was Fred Porter,
whom he had met several times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to tell you a whole lot, Ralph, but I
can&#8217;t do it!&#8221; Zeph had burst out. &#8220;Say, one thing,
though; I&#8217;m going to tell my employer about Fred
Porter being so anxious to see him, and you can
write to Porter and tell him that his friend is all
right and safe, if you want to. What&#8217;s that
address&mdash;I may get around to Porter myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph told Zeph. That same evening the latter
left Stanley Junction, and Ralph had not heard
from him since, nor did he receive word from
Fred. Temporarily, at least, Zeph, Fred and the
railroad president&#8217;s son, Marvin Clark, the
&#8220;Canaries&#8221; and all the peculiar mystery surrounding
them, seemed to have drifted out of the life
of the young engineer.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;999 was about ready to start on her daily
trip when the stranger designated as Lord Montague
had appeared. As he stood against the tender
bar and seemed to commune with himself on
the crudity of American locomotive cabs, Ralph
leaned from the window and hailed a friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Graham,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;you seem particularly
active and restless this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph had reason for the remark. The young
inventor had been very little care to his sponsor
and friend during the past week. Given free
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
access to the roundhouse, Archie had just about
lived there. Quiet and inoffensive, he at first had
been a butt for the jokes of the wipers and the
extras, but his good-natured patience disarmed
those who harmlessly made fun of him, and those
who maliciously persecuted him had one warning
from his sledge-hammer fists, and left him alone
afterwards.</p>
<p>On this especial morning Archie was stirred
with an unusual animation. Ralph noticed this
when he first came down to the roundhouse. The
young inventor hung around the locomotive suspiciously.
He even rode on the pilot of No.&nbsp;999
to the depot, and for the past five minutes he had
paced restlessly up and down the platform as
though the locomotive held some peculiar fascination
for him. As he now came up to the cab
at Ralph&#8217;s hail, his eye ran over the locomotive
in the most interested way in the world, and Ralph
wondered why.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call me, Fairbanks?&#8221; mumbled Archie, and
Ralph could not catch his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, Graham,&#8221; responded Ralph. &#8220;What&#8217;s
stirring you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chasing up&nbsp;999.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It looks that way; it looks to me as if you were
watching the locomotive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s worth watching, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but you act as if you expect her to do
something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! ha!&mdash;that&#8217;s it, h&#8217;m&mdash;you see&mdash;say, wish
I could run down the line with you this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re crowded in the cab, as you see,&#8221;
explained Ralph, &#8220;but if you want the discomfort
of balancing on the tank cover back there&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d dote on it&mdash;thanks, thanks,&#8221; said Archie
with a fervor that increased Ralph&#8217;s curiosity as
to his strange actions this particular morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got some new bee in his head?&#8221; suggested
Fogg, as Archie scrambled up over the coal.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll have a new kind of locomotive built by the
time we clear the limits&mdash;that is, in his mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lord Lionel Montague warmed up to Ralph the
next few minutes before starting time. He asked
a few casual questions about the mechanisms of
No.&nbsp;999, and then seemed tremendously interested
in the young engineer himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken a fawncy to you, Mr. Fairbanks,
don&#8217;t you know,&#8221; he drawled out. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to
cultivate you, quite. I must call on you at Stanley
Junction. There&#8217;s a great deal you might tell
me of interest, don&#8217;t you see.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be happy to be of service to you, Lord
Montague,&#8221; responded Ralph courteously.</p>
<p>He did not like the man. There was something
untrue about his shifty eye. There was a lot of
&#8220;put on&#8221; that did not strike Ralph as natural.
&#8220;His ludship&#8221; harped on the youth of Ralph.
Only veterans were intrusted with important railroad
positions in England&mdash;&#8220;didn&#8217;t he know.&#8221;
He was asking many questions about Ralph&#8217;s
juvenile friends, as if with some secret purpose,
when the train started up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, up there!&#8221; Fogg challenged Archie, seated
on the tank tender top, &#8220;don&#8217;t get moving up there
and tumble off.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young inventor certainly looked as if he
was moving. His eyes were glued to the smokestack
of the locomotive, as though it possessed a
fascinating influence over him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, there&#8217;s some draft this morning,&#8221;
observed the fireman, half-way to the crossing, as
he threw some coal into the furnace.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so,&#8221; replied Ralph; &#8220;some sparks,
too, I notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! that new patent spark arrester don&#8217;t
arrest particularly,&#8221; commented Fogg. &#8220;Queer,&#8221;
he added, with a speculative eye on the smokestack.</p>
<p>That appendage of No.&nbsp;999 was shooting out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
showers of sparks like a roman candle. As she
slid the splits at the crossing and got down to real
business, the display was very noticeable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d say that some of our old time enemies were
doctoring the fuel, if it wasn&#8217;t that the crowd is
off the job after that last drubbing I gave Hall
and Wilson,&#8221; remarked the fireman. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
understand it. That draft is pulling the coal up
through the flues fast as I can shovel it in.
Thunder!&#8221;</p>
<p>With a yell the fireman of No.&nbsp;999, as he
opened the furnace door to throw in more coal,
leaped to one side.</p>
<p>A cyclonic stream, like the sudden blast of a
volcano, poured out into the cab.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>ARCHIE GRAHAM&#8217;S INVENTION</h3>
</div>
<p>The cab was suddenly filled with smoke, ashes
and steam. Something unusual had happened.
Unable to determine it all in a minute, Ralph
pulled the lever and set the air brakes.</p>
<p>Mingled with the jar and the hiss of steam there
arose a great cry&mdash;it was a vast human roar, ringing,
anguished, terrified. It proceeded from the
lips of the self-dubbed Lord Montague, and glancing
towards the tender Ralph witnessed a startling
sight.</p>
<p>The monocled, languid-aired nobleman had
struck a pose against the tender bar, and as Fogg
opened the furnace door and the fire box suddenly
belched out a sheet of flame and then a perfect
cloud of ashes, the passenger of high degree was
engulfed. Fogg, alert to his duty, after nimbly
skipping aside, had kicked the furnace door shut.
He was not quick enough, however, to prevent
what seemed to be half the contents of the furnace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
from pouring out a great cascade of ashes
as if shot from a cannon, taking the astounded and
appalled Montague squarely down his front.</p>
<p>&#8220;Murder!&#8221; he yelled, and grasped his head in
his hands to brush away the hot ashes that were
searing his face.</p>
<p>As he did so he became a new personality. His
mustache was brushed from his lip and fell to the
bottom of the cab, while its former possessor
made a mad dive to one side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, you chump!&#8221; cried Fogg; &#8220;do you want
to kill yourself?&#8221; and grabbing the singed and
frightened passenger, he pinned him against the
coal and held him there. In doing this he brushed
one whisker from the side of his captive&#8217;s face,
and the latter lay panting and groaning with
nearly all his fictitious make-up gone and quite all
of his nerve collapsed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened?&#8221; asked Ralph, as they
slowed down.</p>
<p>&#8220;It felt like a powder blast,&#8221; declared Fogg.</p>
<p>Archie Graham had uttered a cry of dismay&mdash;of
discovery, too, it seemed to Ralph. The young
engineer glanced at his friend perched on the top
of the tender tank. The face of the young inventor
was a study.</p>
<p>Archie acted less like a person startled than as
one surprised. He appeared to be neither shocked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
nor particularly interested. His expression was
that of one disappointed. It suddenly flashed
across Ralph, he could scarcely have told why,
that the young inventor had indeed been &#8220;inventing&#8221;
something, that something had slipped a cog,
and that he was responsible for the catastrophe
of the moment. Now Archie looked about him in
a stealthy, baffled way, as though he was anxious
to sneak away from the scene.</p>
<p>Half-blinded, sputtering and a sight, &#8220;his ludship&#8221;
struggled out of the grasp of the fireman.
His monocle was gone. His face, divested of its
hirsute appendages, Ralph observed, was a decidedly
evil face. As the train came to a halt the dismantled
passenger stepped from the cab, and
wrathfully tearing the remaining false whiskers
from place, sneaked down the tracks, seeking
cover from his discomfiture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi! you&#8217;ve left that nobleman face of yours
behind you,&#8221; shouted Fogg after him. &#8220;What&#8217;s
his game, Fairbanks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It staggers me,&#8221; confessed Ralph. &#8220;Hello,
there, Graham!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the young inventor with due haste was disappearing
over the rear of the tender, as though
he was ashamed of a part in the puzzling occurrence
at the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s wrong,&#8221; muttered Fogg, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
opened the furnace door timidly. There was no
further outburst of ashes. &#8220;Queer,&#8221; he commented.
&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t have been powder. I
noticed a draft soon as we started. What made
it? Where is it now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was only when we were running fast,&#8221; submitted
Ralph.</p>
<p>The fireman leaped down to the tracks. He
inspected the locomotive from end to end. Then
he began ferretting under the engine. Ralph
watched him climb between the drivers. Strange,
muffled mutterings announced some discovery.
In a moment or two Fogg crawled out again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I vum!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;What is this contraption?&#8221;</p>
<p>He grasped a piece of wire-netted belting, and
as he trailed out its other end, to it was attached
a queer-looking device that resembled a bellows.
Its frame was of iron, and it had a tube with a
steel nozzle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; observed the young engineer, in a speculative
tone, &#8220;where did that come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I found its nozzle end stuck in through one
end of the draft holes in the fire box,&#8221; answered
Fogg. &#8220;This belt ran around two axles and
worked it. Who put it there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Graham,&#8221; announced Ralph politely. &#8220;Well&mdash;well&mdash;I
understand his queer actions now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
Bring it up here,&#8221; continued Ralph, as the fireman
was about to throw it aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;The young fellow who thinks he is going to
overturn the system with his inventions? Well,
he must have done a lot of work, and it must have
taken a heap of time to fix the thing so it worked.
The belt was adjusted to a T. Say, you&#8217;d better
keep him out of the roundhouse, or he&#8217;ll experiment
on us some day in a way that may lead to
something serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph put the contrivance under his seat for
more leisurely inspection later on. He had to
smile to think of the patience, the ingenuity and
the eccentric operation of the well-meant project
of his young inventor friend. The bellows principle
of increasing the furnace draft might have
been harmless in a stationary engine. Even on
the locomotive it had shown some added suction
power while the locomotive was going ahead, but
the moment the furnace door was opened the current
of air from below sought the nearest vent.
That was why &#8220;his ludship&#8221; had retired under a
decided cloud in more ways than one.</p>
<p>When they arrived at Riverton the young engineer
made a search for both Archie and the disguised
impostor. He located neither. From
what he gathered from the conductor, Archie
had left the train at the first station after the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
stop. The pretended English lord had been
noticed footing it back towards Stanley Junction.</p>
<p>The return trip was uneventful. Archie did
not put in an appearance, and Ralph fancied he
might have gone back to Bridgeport. The next
morning when Ralph reported for duty, little
Torchy, the call boy, sidled up to him in a confidential
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Mr. Fairbanks&mdash;I noticed a fellow was
on your cab on your run yesterday that I have
seen before&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; answered Ralph curiously; &#8220;what
about him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing much, only he was around here a couple
of days ago. He pretended that he wanted to
see the inside of a roundhouse, and Mr. Forgan
sent me with him to show him about. When he
got me alone he began asking me all about you.
Then he tried to pump me about all your boy
friends. I didn&#8217;t like his looks or his actions, so
I thought I would tell you what I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;If you ever run
against him again, tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, sure,&#8221; responded the staunch little fellow,
who had a genuine friendship for Ralph, who
had encouraged him greatly, by initiating him into
roundhouse duties when he first came to work for
the Great Northern.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>Ralph could not fathom the possible motive of
the stranger, who apparently was somehow interested
in his doings. When they started out on
their regular run, he told Fogg what Torchy had
imparted to him. The fireman reflected speculatively
over the disclosure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand what the fellow is up to,&#8221;
he admitted, &#8220;unless one of the gangs is up to a
new trick and has hired a stranger to work it on
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long wait at Riverton after arrival
that day. Then they were sided, and Fogg
strolled off to a restaurant. Ralph sat down on
a pile of ties at the side of the track and enjoyed
the lunch that he had brought with him from
home. He had just finished it and was about to
go to the cab and get a book on railroading to
read, when a tall, farmer-appearing fellow came
upon the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;is this&nbsp;999&mdash;yes, I see
it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; nodded Ralph; &#8220;what about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see the engineer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the engineer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Name Fairbanks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sent to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By whom?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know&mdash;never saw the boy before. He&#8217;s
a stranger in Riverton. Came up to me and gave
me a half-a-dollar to come here and deliver a message
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me know it,&#8221; directed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out here on the tracks, and I&#8217;ll show you
where he said you was to come to see him. See
that old shed over beyond those freights? Well,
the boy said you was to come there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he did?&#8221; commented Ralph musingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he said to come alone, as it was particular.
He said you&#8217;d know when I said Martin&mdash;Martin,
oh, yes, Clark, that&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marvin Clark,&#8221; decided the young railroader
at once, and as the messenger went his way Ralph
ran to the engine cab, threw off his jacket and
then walked down the tracks. He of course
thought of Fred Porter at once. It looked as
though that individual had turned up again and
had sent for him, and Ralph was glad to hear
from him at last.</p>
<p>The building that had been pointed out to him
by the boy messenger was a storage shed for
repair tools and supplies. Ralph passed a line of
damaged freights, and reaching the shed, found
its door open. He stepped across the threshold
and peered around among the heaps of iron and
steel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is anybody here?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, two of us,&#8221; promptly responded a harsh,
familiar voice, that gave Ralph a start, for the
next instant his arms were seized, drawn behind
him, and the young engineer of No.&nbsp;999 found
himself a prisoner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>IKE SLUMP AGAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>Ralph knew at once that he had fallen into a
trap of some kind. He struggled violently, but
it was of no avail. Two persons had slipped up
behind him, two pairs of hands were holding him
captive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; demanded the young engineer
sharply, over his shoulder.</p>
<p>There was no response, but he was forced forward
clear back into the shed. The front door
was kicked shut. Ralph was thrown roughly
among a heap of junk. He recovered himself
quickly and faced his assailants.</p>
<p>The light in the place was dim and uncertain.
The only glazed aperture in the shed was a small
window at the rear. With considerable interest
Ralph strained his gaze in an endeavor to make
out his captors. Then in immense surprise he
recognized both.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ike Slump and Jim Evans,&#8221; he spoke aloud
involuntarily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You call the roll,&#8221; observed Evans with a
sneer.</p>
<p>Ralph reflected rapidly. The last he had heard
of this precious brace of comrades, they had been
sentenced to prison for a series of bold thefts
from the railroad company. How they had gotten
free he could not decide. He fancied that they
had in some way escaped. At all events, they
were here, and the mind of the young engineer
instantly ran to one of two theories as to their
plans: Either the gang at Stanley Junction had
hired them to annoy or imperil him, or Slump and
Evans were inspired by motives of personal
revenge.</p>
<p>Ike Slump had been a trouble to Ralph when he
first began his ambitious railroad career. It was
Slump who had hated him from the start when
Ralph began his apprenticeship with the Great
Northern, as related in &#8220;Ralph of the Roundhouse.&#8221;
Ralph had detected Slump and others in
a plot to rob the railroad company of a lot of
brass journal fittings. From that time on through
nearly every stage of Ralph&#8217;s upward career,
Slump had gone steadily down the easy slope of
crime.</p>
<p>When he linked up with Evans, his superior
in years and cunning, he had several times sought
revenge against Ralph, and but for the vigilance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
and courage of the young engineer his life might
have paid the forfeit.</p>
<p>Evans acted promptly, wasting no words. He
had drawn a weapon from his pocket, and this he
handed to Slump. Then he turned a fierce, lowering
visage upon Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks,&#8221; he began, &#8220;you&#8217;re to go with us&mdash;where,
don&#8217;t matter, nor why. We owe you one,
as you&#8217;ve known for a long time, and if it wasn&#8217;t
that we&#8217;re here for the money there is in it, and
not revenge, I&#8217;d take pleasure in balancing the
months you got us in jail by crippling you so you&#8217;d
never pull another lever. This is business, though,
pure and simple. If you get hurt, you can blame
yourself. You&#8217;ve got to go with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why have I?&#8221; demanded Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we say so. There&#8217;s a man quite anxious
to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s telling. He wants to ask you just one
question. A civil answer given, and you are free
as the wind. Slump, take this pistol, get up on that
pile of rails, and guard Fairbanks. If he starts
to run, shoot&mdash;understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I do!&#8221; snarled the graceless Ike, climbing
to the top of the pile of rails. &#8220;When I think
of what this fellow has done to down me, it makes
my blood boil.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back with a wagon in fifteen minutes,&#8221;
said Evans. &#8220;You take your medicine quietly,
Fairbanks, and nobody will get hurt. Try any
capers, and blame yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker proceeded to the door of the shed,
opened it, and closed it after himself as if everything
was settled his way. Ike Slump, regarding
the captive with a venomous expression of face,
sat poising his weapon with the manner of a person
glad to have an occasion arise that would warrant
its use under the instructions given by his
partner.</p>
<p>Ralph summed up the situation and counted his
chances. It was apparent to him that only a bold,
reckless dash could avail him. There was no
chance to pounce upon and disarm the enemy,
however, and Ralph hesitated about seeking any
risks with a fellow who held him so completely at
his mercy.</p>
<p>&#8220;How does it seem?&#8221; jeered Ike, after a spell
of silence, but Ralph did not answer at once. He
had experienced no actual fear when so suddenly
seized. Now, although he could not disregard a
certain risk and menace in the custody of two of
his worst enemies, a study of the face of the youth
before him made the young railroader marvel as
to what he could find enticing in doing wrong, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
he actually felt sorrow and sympathy, instead of
thinking of his own precarious situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slump,&#8221; spoke Ralph finally, &#8220;I am sorry for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That so? Ho! ho! truly?&#8221; gibed the graceless
Ike. &#8220;What game are you up to? Don&#8217;t try
any, I warn you. You&#8217;re clever, Ralph Fairbanks,
but I&#8217;m slick. You see, the tables have turned. I
knew they would, some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it you fellows want of me, anyhow?&#8221;
ventured Ralph, hoping to induce Ike to disclose
something.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to worry about,&#8221; declared Slump
carelessly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll soon know. Say, though,
Fairbanks, don&#8217;t stir the lion, don&#8217;t pull his tail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to be talking about menageries,&#8221;
observed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll think you&#8217;re in one, sure enough, if you
rile Evans up. He won&#8217;t stand any fooling, you
hear me. Shut up, now. We&#8217;ll leave discussing
things till this job is over and done with. Then I
may have something to tell you on my own personal
account, see?&#8221; and Ike tried to look very
fierce and dangerous. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you something to
think of, though. You&#8217;re going to tell a certain
man all you know about a certain fellow, and
you&#8217;re going to fix it so that the certain man can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
find the certain fellow, or you don&#8217;t run&nbsp;999 for a
time to come, I&#8217;ll bet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is this certain man?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know his name. He&#8217;s a stranger to
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who is the certain fellow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that one&mdash;I don&#8217;t mind telling you.
Then shut up. You&#8217;ve a way of worming things
out of people, and I&#8217;m not going to help you any&mdash;it&#8217;s
Marvin Clark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was,&#8221; nodded the young engineer
reflectively; and then there was a spell of silence.</p>
<p>Ralph could only conjecture as to the significance
of Ike&#8217;s statement. There certainly was
some vivid interest that centered about the missing
son of the railroad president. That name, Marvin
Clark, had been used to lure Ralph to the old
shed. Now it was again employed. It took a
far flight of fancy to discern what connection
young Clark might have with these two outcasts&mdash;worse,
criminals. Ralph decided that their only
mission in any plot surrounding Clark was that of
hired intermediaries. He did not know why, but
somehow he came to the conclusion that Evans
and Slump were acting in behalf of the pretended
Lord Montague. Why and wherefore he could
not imagine, but he believed that through circumstances
now developing he would soon find out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>Slump shifted around on the pile of rails a
good deal. They afforded anything but a comfortable
resting place. Finally he seemed to
decide that he would change his seat. He edged
along with the apparent intention of reaching a
heap of spike kegs. He never, however, took his
eye away from Ralph. Ike, too, held his weapon
at a continual menace, and gave his captive no
chance to act against him or run for the door.</p>
<p>Near the end of the pile of rails, Ike prepared
to descend backwards to the spike kegs. He
planned to do this without for an instant relaxing
his vigilance. As he reached out one foot to touch
the rails, there was an ominous grinding sound.
He had thrown his weight on one rail. The contact
pushed this out of place.</p>
<p>Once started, the whole heap began to shift.
Ralph, quite awed, saw the pile twist out of shape,
and, tumbling in their midst, was his watcher.
A scream of mortal agony rang through the old
shed, and Ike Slump landed on the floor with
half a ton of rails pinioning his lower limbs.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXIII_A_CRITICAL_MOMENT' id='CHAPTER_XXIII_A_CRITICAL_MOMENT'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>A CRITICAL MOMENT</h3>
</div>
<p>If the rails under which Ike Slump lay had not
caught at their ends with other rails, his limbs
would have been crushed out of all semblance.
Ralph noted this at once, and as well the extreme
peril of the situation of the enemy who, a minute
previous had been gloating over his helplessness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move&mdash;for your life, don&#8217;t move!&#8221;
shouted Ralph, and he sprang forward in front of
the pinioned Ike Slump.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m killed, I&#8217;m crushed to death!&#8221; bellowed
Ike. &#8220;Oh, help! help!&#8221;</p>
<p>The weapon had fallen from his hand. Both
arms wildly sawing the air, Ike shivered and
shrank like the arrant craven he was at heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do just as I say,&#8221; ordered the young engineer
breathlessly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t stir&mdash;don&#8217;t even breathe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph had jumped to the end of the pile of
rails. His quick eye selected the one rail that was
the key of the tangle, which, directed wrong,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
would sweep the mass with crushing force across
the pinioned body of Ike. The rails were short
lengths. But for this, Ralph, strong as he was,
could have done little or nothing. He got a grasp
upon the rail. Then he sung out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slip when I lift.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&mdash;I can&#8217;t!&#8221; wailed Ike.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to&mdash;now!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph gave a tug at the rail. There was an ominous
grind and quiver as the others interlocked.
He made a tremendous lift, one which strained
every sinew and started the perspiration from
every pore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m numbed, I&#8217;m all crushed!&#8221; snivelled Ike;
nevertheless he managed to crawl out, or rather
slip out from under the uplifted rail. He rolled
on the dirt floor of the shed, making a great ado.
It was just in time, for Ralph felt his eyes
starting from his head. He dropped the heavy
mass he had sustained and staggered back, well-nigh
overcome.</p>
<p>As his breath came back to him, Ralph glanced
particularly at Ike. The latter was completely absorbed
in his own sufferings. Ralph could discern
from the movements of his limbs that neither
of them was dislocated and apparently no bones
were broken. Still, he realized that they must be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
badly bruised and that Ike was disabled, at least
for a time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going for help,&#8221; he said simply, and darted
from the shed. Ike yelled after him to protest
against desertion, but Ralph paid no attention.
He planned to get to friends while Evans was
still away, and he determined to get back with
friends by the time Evans returned.</p>
<p>Fogg was at the engine as Ralph ran along the
tracks, and one of the brakemen of the accommodation
was with him. Ralph rapidly apprized his
fireman of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slump and Evans, eh!&#8221; muttered Fogg, a deep
crinkle of belligerency crossing his forehead. &#8220;It
was Slump who stole half my chickens. As to
Evans, his mean treachery during the strike came
near getting me discharged. I thought they were
safe in jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So did I,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;They seem to have
escaped, though. Mr. Fogg, they are bad people
to have at large.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad! they&#8217;re of a dangerous breed, I tell you.
Simmons, hustle along with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fireman snatched up a furnace poker and
put down the track after Ralph, on the run. He
was the first to dart into the shed when they
reached it, and ran up against the others following,
after a swift glance about the place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No one here,&#8221; he reported. &#8220;Gone&mdash;they&#8217;ve
slipped us&mdash;there&#8217;s no one in this shed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I see,&#8221; spoke Ralph, with a look about the
place outside. &#8220;Here are wagon wheels,&#8221; and
then he cast his eye across the landscape.</p>
<p>It was so crowded with tracks, buildings and
trees beyond that he could not look far in the
distance. Ralph, however, was satisfied that
Evans, returning with the wagon, had made haste
to carry his helpless comrade to the vehicle and
get beyond reach of capture.</p>
<p>Fogg was for starting a pursuit, but Ralph convinced
him of the futility of this course, and they
returned to the locomotive. Once there, the fireman
went over the case in all its bearings. Ralph
had heretofore told him little concerning Fred
Porter and Marvin Clark. He had shown him
the photograph of the latter some days previous,
asking him to keep an eye out for its original.
Now he felt that some confidence was due his
loyal cab mate, and he recited the entire story of
what he knew and his surmises.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a square head, Fairbanks,&#8221; said
Fogg, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll rely on it every time. It&#8217;s logic
to think your way. Some fellow is mightily interested
in this young Clark. None too good is the
fellow, either, or he wouldn&#8217;t have to beat around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
the bush. No, he&#8217;s not straight, or he wouldn&#8217;t
hire such fellows as Evans and Ike Slump to help
him out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it all,&#8221; confessed Ralph,
&#8220;but I can see that a good deal of mysterious interest
centers around this young Clark. I&#8217;m
going to try and get some word to Porter&mdash;and to
Zeph Dallas. They should know what&#8217;s going
on regarding Clark.&#8221;</p>
<p>The incident did not depart from the young engineer&#8217;s
mind during the return trip to Stanley
Junction, nor for several days later. With the
escape of Evans and Ike Slump, however, the
episode ended, at least for the time being. A
week and more passed by, and that precious pair
and their presumable employer, the pretended
Lord Montague, seemed to have drifted out of
existence quite as fully as had Zeph, Porter and
young Clark.</p>
<p>One morning there was an animated discussion
going on when Ralph entered the roundhouse.
He was greatly interested in it, although he did
not share in the general commotion.</p>
<p>The result of somebody&#8217;s &#8220;confidential&#8221; talk
with the division superintendent had leaked out&mdash;the
Great Northern was figuring to soon announce
its new train.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As I get it,&#8221; observed old John Griscom, &#8220;the
road is in for a bid on the service the Midland
Central is getting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean through business?&#8221; spoke an
inquiring voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, that,&#8221; assented the veteran railroader.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve beat them on the China &amp; Japan Mail run
to Bridgeport, and now the scheme is to run the
Overland Express in from the north, catch her
up here, and cut out Bridgeport at a saving of fifty
miles on the regular western run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they will have to take the Mountain
Division from Stanley Junction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just that, if they expect to make the time
needed,&#8221; assented Griscom. &#8220;Hey, Bill Somers,&#8221;
to a grizzled old fellow with one arm, who was
shaking his head seriously at all this confab,
&#8220;what you mooning about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t take that run,&#8221; croaked Somers, &#8220;if
they gave me a solid gold engine with the tender
full of diamonds. I left an arm on that route.
Say, Dave Little and I had a construction run
over those sliding curves up and down the canyon
grades. It lasted a month. There were snowslides,
washouts, forest fires. There&#8217;s a part of
the road that&#8217;s haunted. There&#8217;s a hoodoo over
one section, where they kill a man about once a
week. Little lost his leg and his job there. My
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
old arm is sleeping thereabouts in some ravine.
No Mountain Division run for me, boys!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t get it, never fear,&#8221; observed a
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I know that,&#8221; retorted Somers a little
sadly, indicating his helplessness by moving his
stump of an arm, &#8220;but I pity the fellow who
does.&#8221;</p>
<p>Day by day after that there were new additions
to the fund of gossip concerning the new run.
It all interested Ralph. Nothing definite, however,
was as yet stated officially. Ralph and Fogg
continued on the accommodation, and there was
now little break in the regular routine of their
railroad experience.</p>
<p>Ralph had made a short cut across the switch
yards one morning, when a stirring episode
occurred that he was not soon to forget, nor others.
It took an expert to thread the maze of cars
in motion, trains stalled on sidings, and trains
arriving and departing.</p>
<p>It was the busiest hour of the day, and Ralph
kept his eye out sharply. He had paused for a
moment in a clear triangle formed by diverging
rails, to allow an outward bound train to clear
the switch, when a man on the lower step of the
last car waved his hand and hailed him.</p>
<p>It was the master mechanic, and Ralph was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
pleased at the notice taken of him, and interested
to learn what the official wanted of him. The
master mechanic, alighting, started across the
tracks to join Ralph.</p>
<p>A train was backing on the one track between
them. Another train was moving out on the rails
still nearer to Ralph.</p>
<p>It was a scene of noise, commotion and confusion.
If the master mechanic had been a
novice in railroad routine, Ralph could not have
repressed a warning shout, for with his usual
coolness that official, timing all train movements
about him with his practiced eye, made a quick run
to clear the train backing in to the depot. He calculated
then, Ralph foresaw, to cross the tracks
along which the outgoing train was coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s taking a risk&mdash;it&#8217;s a graze,&#8221; murmured
the young engineer in some trepidation.</p>
<p>The master mechanic was alert and nimble,
though past middle age. He took the chances
of a spry jump across the rails, his eye fixed on
the outgoing train, aiming to get across to Ralph
before it passed. In landing, however, he miscalculated.
The run and jump brought him to a dead
halt against a split switch. His foot drove into
the jaws of the frog as if wedged there by the
blow of a sledge-hammer.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXIV_THE_NEW_RUN' id='CHAPTER_XXIV_THE_NEW_RUN'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE NEW RUN</h3>
</div>
<p>The young engineer stood shocked and motionless&mdash;only,
however, for the minutest fraction of
a moment. A railroad man&#8217;s life is full of sudden
surprises and situations calling for prompt,
decisive and effective action. Ralph had learned
this from experience.</p>
<p>The master mechanic was in the direct path of
the train backing into the depot. The one he had
just left and the one proceeding in the same direction
shut him in where there was no flagman or
switches. The train bearing down upon him was
on a rounding bend of rails, the locomotive not
in view, and there was no possible chance of signalling
the engineer.</p>
<p>As Ralph started forward the engine of the
outbound train passed him. He waited for one
car only to pass him. How he skimmed its rear
platform he never knew. It was a daring, reckless
spring, and he landed on the planking beyond
the rails on a dizzying slide. The next instant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
he was at the side of the imperilled railroad official.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m caught!&#8221; gasped the master mechanic,
with a white but set face, as he recognized Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swing down!&#8221; cried the young railroader.
&#8220;It&#8217;s your only chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The master mechanic barely suppressed a groan
as he toppled sideways. The twist to his ankle
made him wince. Ralph saw that his foot was
held as in a vise. No amount of pulling could get
him free. The train backing down was less than
thirty feet away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold steady,&#8221; breathed Ralph in a shaking
tone, and his hand dove for his pocket. He
recalled it all afterwards as a remarkable thing
that, standing there, a great peril hovering, there
seemed to flash through his mind a vivid photograph
of Torchy.</p>
<p>The call boy at the roundhouse was a great
friend of the young engineer. Ralph had been his
model, as was he his friend. He had loaned the
little fellow a book on railroading that had
delighted Torchy, and observing Ralph sharpening
a peg for his bumper with a decidedly blunt-edged
knife, he had begged the privilege of getting
it sharpened for him.</p>
<p>When he had returned the knife to Ralph the
day previous, Torchy declared that it was sharp
as a razor and would cut a hair in two. Ralph
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
found this to be no exaggeration. In addition
Torchy had oiled the blade hinges. Now the
young engineer thought of Torchy and of the
knife as he drew it from his pocket, whipped open
its big blade and made a dive rather than a swoop
beside the body of the master mechanic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pull back your foot!&#8221; cried Ralph, and made
a swoop. The flanges of the near truck wheels
were grinding on the edge of the rails not five
feet away. Ralph&#8217;s arm described a deft oval
movement. In one swift stroke he slit the shoe
from vamp to sole. He was conscious that the
foot of the master mechanic came free. Then
something struck Ralph, and he felt himself
tossed aside inert and unconscious by some stunning
force.</p>
<p>When he again opened his eyes Ralph caught
the vague hum of a lingo of switch pidgin, smut-faced,
blear-eyed men near by, himself stretched
at full length on sleeping car cushions on the floor
of the doghouse. He sat up promptly. There
was a momentary blur to his sight, but this quickly
passed away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha&mdash;only a bump&mdash;I told you so!&#8221; cried
bluff-hearted Tim Forgan, the foreman, jumping
from a bench and approaching Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Fairbanks?&#8221; questioned John Griscom,
coming to his side.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Right as a trivet,&#8221; reported Ralph, getting to
his feet. &#8220;What hit me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The step of a coach, it seems,&#8221; explained
Forgan.</p>
<p>Ralph passed his hand over his head until it
rested on a lump and a sore spot near one ear. It
was wet and greasy where some liniment had been
applied.</p>
<p>&#8220;The master mechanic?&#8221; he asked, with a quick
memory of what had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ankle wrenched,&#8221; said Griscom. &#8220;We made
him get to a surgeon on a litter. He minded
nothing but you, till he was sure that you were all
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph uttered a vast sigh of relief and satisfaction.
Forgan led him to his own special office
armchair. Half-a-dozen crowded about him,
curious for details of the accident no one of them
had witnessed.</p>
<p>Ralph gave them the particulars as he could
remember them. He asked for a drink of water,
felt of the bump again with a smiling grimace,
and arose to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Same schedule, I suppose?&#8221; he inquired, starting
to go outside the doghouse and inspect the
bulletin board on which daily orders were posted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that you are going to make
your run to-day, Fairbanks?&#8221; asked the foreman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Used up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; queried Ralph with a smile. &#8220;Then I
don&#8217;t know it. I fancy it was a narrow escape,
and I am grateful for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The master mechanic was looking for you
when he got frogged,&#8221; observed Griscom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I thought he was,&#8221; nodded Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Fairbanks,&#8221; broke in the foreman of
the roundhouse, &#8220;tack up this flimsy with the
rest, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph took the tissue sheet tendered, stepped
through the open doorway into the roundhouse,
and set the sheet upon two tacks on the bulletin
board. He started to stroll over to No.&nbsp;999 in
her stall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; challenged Forgan; &#8220;that flimsy
just came in. It&#8217;s an important order. Better
read it, Fairbanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented Ralph, and turning, cast
his eyes at the sheet. They distended wide, for
this is what he read:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; '>&#8220;No. 7, new train, Overland Express, Mountain
Division, 6.12 p.&nbsp;m., beginning Monday, the 15th.
Engineer: Fairbanks&mdash;Fireman: Fogg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; was all that Ralph could gasp out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>A great hearty hand, that of the old railroad
veteran, John Griscom, landed on Ralph&#8217;s shoulder
with a resounding slap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks!&#8221; he roared in the ear of the bewildered
young engineer, &#8220;the top rung of the ladder
at last!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE MOUNTAIN DIVISION</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Well, lad, you&#8217;ve passed muster and got to
the head of the class!&#8221; proclaimed old John
Griscom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; dissented Ralph Fairbanks; &#8220;I&#8217;m just
started in to learn what real railroading means.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d call you a pretty apt student, then,&#8221; put in
Tim Forgan, foreman of the Stanley Junction
roundhouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s any man, boy or child in this doghouse
who says that young Fairbanks isn&#8217;t a
crackerjack, let him step right up here and take
his medicine!&#8221; vaunted Lemuel Fogg, playfully,
but with a proud look of admiration at the expert
young engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the best part of it to know that you fellows
mean every word you say and believe in
me,&#8221; observed Ralph. &#8220;Your encouragement and
influence have boosted me up to the Overland
Express all right&mdash;I&#8217;ll try and never make you
ashamed of having backed me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>Ralph Fairbanks felt good and showed it. His
friends shared in his emotions and sentiments, and
that made the present occasion doubly glad and
welcome. It was one of those rare moments, coming
only once in a while, when Ralph and his comrades
had an idle half hour to chat and compliment
each other in the doghouse.</p>
<p>The Overland Express had become an established
feature of the Great Northern&mdash;as little
Torchy had phrased it, &#8220;a howling success.&#8221; A
week had gone by, and now, seated in the midst of
his loyal friends, Ralph felt that he had made
good on a promotion that placed him at the top
notch of engineering service.</p>
<p>It was a big thing for a youth to gain that high
distinction&mdash;engineer of the Overland Express.
Looking back over the active, energetic career
that had led up to this, however, Ralph realized
that the climax had been reached a step at a time
through patience, perseverance and genuine hard
work. It was a proof to him that any person
following discipline and having as a motto precision
and finality, was bound to succeed. It was
a most enjoyable breathing spell to realize that
all the anxiety, dash and novelty of the experimental
trips over the Mountain Division were
past, and he now felt that he knew the route and
all its details perfectly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>Ralph had found time to do some thinking
about his friends the past day or two. He had
seen two of them, for Van Sherwin and little
Limpy Joe had come down from the Short Line,
and had spent a pleasant day at the Fairbanks
home. Archie Graham, too, had put in an appearance.
The young inventor looked shamefaced and
distressed when he admitted all that Ralph had
guessed concerning the patent bellows&mdash;draft
improvement for locomotives.</p>
<p>&#8220;It only worked the wrong way,&#8221; explained
Archie; &#8220;next time&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time try it on some other railroad,
Archie,&#8221; advised Ralph. &#8220;They&#8217;re watching for
you with rifles down at the Great Northern roundhouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; snorted Archie contemptuously;
&#8220;they&#8217;ll be sorry when I strike some real big thing
and another line gets it. Now then, I&#8217;ve got something
brand new&mdash;the rocket danger signal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go right ahead experimenting with it, only
choose a spot where you won&#8217;t hurt any one,&#8221;
advised Ralph. &#8220;You&#8217;re all right, Archie,&#8221;
declared the young railroader, slapping his comrade
appreciatively on the shoulder, &#8220;only you are
too ambitious. I have no doubt that you will
some day hit something tangible. It&#8217;s a long,
patient road, though&mdash;this inventing things.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You bet it is,&#8221; assented Archie with force.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you attempt too grand beginnings. Take
something more simple and easy than trying to
revolutionize railroad service all at once, and
gradually work up to bigger things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, there&#8217;s sense in that, an old inventor told
me the same thing,&#8221; said Archie; &#8220;but you see this
rocket danger signal of mine is a new thing. I&#8217;m
going to Bridgeport to-morrow to get some fixings
I have in my workshop there. You&#8217;ll hear
from me later, Fairbanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Concerning Zeph, Fred Porter and Marvin
Clark the young railroader had heard nothing
since the last visit of Zeph to Stanley Junction.
Many a time he wondered what had become of
them. He had all kinds of theories as to their
continued mysterious absence, but no solution
offered as time wore on.</p>
<p>The Overland Express had not become an old
thing with Ralph. He felt that the charm and
novelty of running the crack train of the road
could never wear out. With each trip, however,
there came a feeling of growing strength and self-reliance.
Ralph had learned to handle the proposition
aptly, and he took a great pride in the time
record so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lively run, and no mistake,&#8221; he remarked
to Fogg, as they started out from the depot that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
evening. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t had any of the direful mishaps,
though, that those old doghouse croakers
predicted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted the fireman, but he accompanied
the word with a serious shake of the head;
&#8220;that&#8217;s to come. I&#8217;m trained enough to guess
that another frost or two will end in the season
that every railroad man dreads. Wait till the
whiskers get on the rails, lad, and a freshet or two
strikes&nbsp;999. There&#8217;s some of those culverts make
me quake when I think of the big ice gorges likely
to form along Dolliver&#8217;s Creek. Oh, we&#8217;ll get
them&mdash;storms, snowslides and blockades. The
only way is to remember the usual winter warning,
&#8216;extra caution,&#8217; keep cool, and stick to the cab
to the last.&#8221;</p>
<p>Summer had faded into autumn, and one or two
sharp frosts had announced the near approach of
winter. The day before there had been a slight
snow flurry. A typical fall day and a moonlit night
had followed, however, and Ralph experienced the
usual pleasure as they rolled back the miles under
flying wheels. They took the sharp curves as
they ran up into the hills with a scream of triumph
from the locomotive whistle every time they
made a new grade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Waste of steam, lad, that,&#8221; observed Fogg, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
they rounded a curve and struck down into a cut
beyond which lay the town of Fordham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better to be safe,&#8221; responded Ralph. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a crossing right ahead where the old spur cuts in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but who ever crosses it?&#8221; demanded the
fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one did two nights ago,&#8221; insisted Ralph.
&#8220;I&#8217;m positive that we just grazed a light wagon
crossing the roadway leading into the cut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it was some stray farmer lost off his
route,&#8221; declared Fogg. &#8220;Why, that old spur has
been rusting away for over five years, to my recollection.
As to the old road beyond being a
highway, that&#8217;s nonsense. There&#8217;s no thoroughfare
beyond the end of the spur. The road ends
at a dismantled, abandoned old factory, and
nobody lives anywhere in this section.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; Toot! toot! toot!</p>
<p>The whistle screeched out sharply. The fireman
stuck his head out of the window. Ralph
had already looked ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare!&#8221; shouted Fogg, staring hard.
&#8220;Swish&mdash;gone! But what was it we passed?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph did not speak. He sat still in a queer
kind of realization of what they both had just
seen, and in the retrospect. While he and his fireman
had been conversing, just ahead in the white
moonlight he had seen two human figures against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
the sky. It was a flashing glimpse only, for the
train was making a forty mile clip, but, dangling
from a tree overhanging the side of the cliff lining
the tracks on one side, he had made out two boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Canaries!&#8221; he murmured to himself, in
profound surprise and deep interest. &#8220;I even
heard them whistle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph was so sure that the little swinging figures
he had seen were the lithe, strange creatures
who had been brought to Stanley Junction by
Zeph Dallas, that he thought about it all the rest
of the trip. He said nothing further to Fogg
about the circumstance, but he resolved to investigate
later on.</p>
<p>The young engineer tried to calculate ahead
how some day soon he could arrange to visit the
vicinity of the old Fordham spur. He was positive
that he had seen the two Canaries. Their
presence at the spur indicated that they must be
denizens of its neighborhood. This being true,
their presence might indicate the proximity of
Zeph Dallas. At least the strange young foreigners
might know what had become of the ardent
young &#8220;detective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph made a good many inquiries of his fireman
as to the Fordham spur. Fogg simply knew
that it ran to an old ruined factory long since
abandoned. On the return trip Ralph kept a sharp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
lookout as they neared the cut. There was no second
appearance of the Canaries, however, nor the
next night, nor that following. The young engineer
found no opportunity of visiting the place,
but he kept his plan to do so constantly in mind.</p>
<p>It was two days later as he made the short cut
to the roundhouse about noon, that Ralph was
greeted by a new discovery that fairly took his
breath away. He had stepped aside to wait till
a locomotive with one car attached passed the
crossing. The peculiar oddness of the car at once
attracted his attention.</p>
<p>It was an old tourist car, used only on far western
railroads. He had seen its like only once or
twice before. Its inside shades were all drawn.
There was no sight of life about it. The locomotive
belonged to the northern branch of the Great
Northern, and had the right of way and was
tracked for the Mountain Division.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a queer layout,&#8221; soliloquized Ralph, as
the strange outfit flashed by. &#8220;Hello!&#8221;</p>
<p>The young engineer uttered a great shout. As
the car passed him he naturally glanced at its rear
platform.</p>
<p>Upon its step in solitary possession of the car
sat his long-lost friend&mdash;Zeph Dallas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>MYSTERY</h3>
</div>
<p>Ralph Fairbanks saw Zeph Dallas distinctly
and recognized him. The latter looked up as the
young engineer uttered an irrepressible shout. He
started to wave his hand. Then he shrank down
on the car step as if seeking to hide himself.</p>
<p>Ralph stood gazing after the coach until it had
disappeared from view. From the look of things
he decided that Zeph was not casually stealing a
ride. Something about him suggested a sense of
proprietorship&mdash;a certain official aspect as if he
had a right to be where Ralph had seen him, was,
in fact, in charge of the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;A queer car&mdash;the queerest old relic I ever
saw,&#8221; mused Ralph. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to look into this
affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Mr. Fairbanks,&#8221; spoke little Torchy as
the young engineer entered the roundhouse; &#8220;just
saw an old friend of ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you?&#8221; spoke Ralph. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean
Zeph Dallas, do you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s who,&#8221; nodded Torchy. &#8220;Big as life
on a single car run&mdash;and, say, such a car!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where it came from, or where it
was bound for?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I heard one of the fellows here say
it must have come over the north branch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so, too,&#8221; said Ralph, and after a
stroll about the place he went down to the dispatcher&#8217;s
office. Ralph knew the railroad routine
well, and he soon had a good friend working in
his interest. He was one of the assistants in the
office of the chief dispatcher. Ralph had loaned
him a little sum of money once when he was off on
the sick list. It had been paid back promptly, but
the man was a grateful fellow, and, under the
influence of a sense of obligation, was glad to
return the favor in any way he could.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix you out, Fairbanks,&#8221; he promised, and
he kept his word, for as Ralph sat in the doghouse
two mornings later the man came to its doorway,
peered in, and beckoned to his friend to come
outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Fairbanks,&#8221; he reported, holding a
card in his hand bearing some memoranda; &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got the tracer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; applauded Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the dope&mdash;that engine and old tourist
car was a kind of a special&mdash;the craziest special,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
though, that either you or I ever heard of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, and see. She started on extra orders
from Brampton, the yards up on the north division.
Was chartered for a run via the Junction
to Fordham spur.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; murmured Ralph thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a plain twenty-four hours&#8217; charter,
same as a picnic or an excursion special, but there
was only one passenger, conductor, or whatever
you might call him&mdash;a kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Ralph, &#8220;Zeph Dallas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could have knocked me down with a
feather when I found that out,&#8221; went on the man
from the dispatcher&#8217;s office, &#8220;although I didn&#8217;t
find it out until later. Yes, the train had been
rented and paid for by our old extra wiper here,
that dreamer, kicker and would-be detective, Dallas.
A pretty penny it must have cost. Where
did he get the money? Skylarking around the
country like a millionaire, and what did he pick
out that antiquated curiosity of a relic car for?
Well, it was the &#8216;Dallas Special,&#8217; sure enough, and
it made its run just the same as if he was a railroad
president inspecting the lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m interested,&#8221; explained Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m jiggergasted,&#8221; added the dispatcher; &#8220;I
got the line on their route by wire to Brampton. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
found that the contract was to run to Fordham
spur and back to Brampton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what for?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;To deliver some special freight presumably,&#8221;
said the dispatcher. &#8220;At first I wondered if
things mightn&#8217;t be stirring up in a new business
way at the old factory. Thought maybe they
were going to do some blasting, and Dallas had
been hired to run through a load of giant powder.
Well, I was off in my guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you find that out?&#8221; asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I caught the Brampton outfit on the return
trip. She had to switch here for an hour to get
the right of way north. I went over to the siding
and happened to know the engineer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where was Zeph?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They left him up at the spur.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; commented Ralph, feeling that Zeph
was indeed enveloping himself in a dense mist of
mystery.</p>
<p>&#8220;The engineer just grinned and haw-hawed
when I asked him about his run. He said that
Dallas had acted like a fellow on the most serious
business, the whole run through. When they got
to the spur he had them run in about two hundred
feet. Then he sat down by the side of the track,
watch in hand, solemnly waited for an hour to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
pass by, and then told the engineer the trip was
ended and he was satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t explain&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; began Ralph in
wonderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word. He just waved his hand grandly
good-by to the engineer, and passed out of sight.
It was a queer go&mdash;wasn&#8217;t it, now? The engineer
and fireman were dumfounded. They looked
into the car out of sheer curiosity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And found?&#8221; pressed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;empty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph was bewildered, and said so. The dispatcher
acknowledged the same sentiment, so had
the engineer and the fireman, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you have it,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Queer
go, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The strangest I ever heard of,&#8221; confessed
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, there&#8217;s no motive to trace,&#8221; observed
the dispatcher in a puzzled, baffled way. &#8220;Think
of the cost of it! Think of the mystery about
the whole affair! What is Dallas up to, and why
the spur?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; admitted the young engineer,
equally perplexed, &#8220;but I&#8217;m going to find out,
make sure of that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>Things were certainly focusing around Fordham
spur, there was no doubt of it. That point of
the road was a decided point of interest to Ralph
every time the Overland Express neared the spur
on succeeding trips. He could only conjecture
that Zeph and the Canaries and others in whom
Zeph was interested, were located somewhere in
the vicinity. However, he caught no sight of any
person in the neighborhood of the spur as he
passed it. The thing was getting to be a worry
to the young engineer, but although he daily promised
himself he would manage some way to visit
the place, no favorable opportunity presented.</p>
<p>The run to Rockton and back had become
harder as cold weather came on. There was a call
for extra vigilance and close attention to routine.
A snowstorm caught them one night on the out
run, and Ralph found out that it was no trifle running
with blurred signals among the deep mountain
cuts. A great rain followed, then a freeze
up, then another heavy fall of snow, and the crew
of the Overland Express had a rigorous week
of it.</p>
<p>They had made the run to Rockton four hours
late on account of a broken bridge, and the next
evening when they reported at the roundhouse,
engineer and fireman found a cancelled trip
instead of readiness for their regular return run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
to Stanley Junction. The foreman was busy in
his office at the telephone, receiving continual
instructions from the dispatcher. He was sending
men and messengers in every direction. The exigencies
of the hour required blockade and wrecking
crews. The foreman looked bothered and
worried, and nodded to Ralph and Fogg in a serious
way as there was a lull at the &#8217;phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;No run to-night, boys,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;You&#8217;d
better get back to your warm beds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blockade on the Mountain Division?&#8221; inquired
the fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse than that. The whole division is
annulled this Side of Fordham, and that&#8217;s over
half the run. Two bridges down, a freight wreck
at Wayne, and the mountain cuts are choked with
drifts. I doubt if you will break through for a
couple of nights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; observed Fogg. &#8220;I fancied to-day&#8217;s
storm would shut up things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has. We&#8217;re half clear south, but west and
north there isn&#8217;t a wheel moving within fifty
miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We may as well make the best of it then, Fairbanks,&#8221;
said the fireman, &#8220;and get back to our
boarding house.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker started for the door and Ralph
followed him. Just then with a sudden roar of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
the tempest outside the door was swept open.
Two snow-covered forms came in.</p>
<p>They were men closely muffled up, and they
paused for a moment to shake the snow from their
heavy enveloping overcoats. The foreman stared
curiously at the intruders. One of them threw
his overcoat open. Fogg grasped Ralph&#8217;s arm
with a start as he seemed to recognize the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he ejaculated in a sharp half whisper.
&#8220;What does this mean, Fairbanks? It&#8217;s the president
of the Great Northern.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE RAILROAD PRESIDENT</h3>
</div>
<p>As the person Fogg designated pushed back his
storm cap and came under the light of a bracket
lamp, Ralph observed that the fireman had been
correct in his surmise&mdash;it was Mr. Robert Grant,
president of the road. He busied himself removing
the snow from his garments and taking in the
warmth of the place, while his companion came
forward to the doghouse.</p>
<p>Ralph and Fogg drew to one side, curious and
interested. They now recognized the man who
had entered the roundhouse with the president as
Lane, superintendent of the Mountain Division of
the Great Northern. His manner was hurried,
worried and serious. A big load of responsibility
rested on his official shoulders, and he realized
it and showed it. He nodded brusquely to Ralph
and Fogg, and then went up to the desk where the
foreman sat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Get the dispatcher&#8217;s office, Jones, and get it
quick,&#8221; he spoke tersely, and he added something
in an undertone. The foreman gave a slight start.
From the way he turned and stared at the companion
of the superintendent, Ralph could trace
that he had just been informed of his identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you are,&#8221; said the foreman, after a minute
at the &#8217;phone and handing the receiver to the
superintendent. The latter, without seating himself,
instantly called over the wire:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Superintendent Lane. I want the chief
dispatcher.&#8221; A pause. &#8220;That you, Martin?&mdash;Yes?&mdash;Hold
the wire. The president of the road
wants to talk with you. Mr. Grant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph knew the railroad president quite well.
It was a long time since he had seen him. That
was at headquarters, after Ralph and some of his
railroad friends had succeeded in rescuing a relative
of the official from a band of blackmailers.
Ralph did not believe that the president
would remember him. He was both surprised and
pleased when the official, glancing about in his
keen, quick way, smiled and mentioned his name
in greeting, nodded to Fogg, and then went up to
the foreman&#8217;s table.</p>
<p>Spread out upon this was an outline map of the
great Northern and all its branches. The foreman
had been utilizing it as an exigency chart. He had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
three pencils beside it&mdash;red, green and blue, and
these he had used to designate by a sort of railroad
signal system the condition of the lines running
out of Rockton. Red signified a wreck or
stalled train, green snow blockades, blue bridges
down and culverts under water. The map was
criss-crossed with other special marks, indicating
obstructions, flood damage and the location of
wrecking crews.</p>
<p>&#8220;As bad as that!&#8221; commented the president in a
grave tone, with a comprehensive glance over the
chart. Then he picked up the receiver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin, chief dispatcher,&#8221; he spoke through
the &#8217;phone. &#8220;Give me the situation over the
Mountain Division in a nutshell.&#8221;</p>
<p>What followed took barely sixty seconds. The
information must have been as distressing as it
was definite, for Ralph noticed a deeper concern
than ever come over the serious face of the official.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the South Branch?&#8221; he inquired next.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s useless, Mr. Grant,&#8221; put in the superintendent,
as the president dropped the receiver with a
disappointed and anxious sigh. After receiving
some further information he again swept his eye
over the map on the table. His fingers mechanically
followed the various divisions outlined there.
The foreman came to his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Mr. Grant,&#8221; he spoke respectfully,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
&#8220;but I&#8217;m in pretty close touch with conditions
along the lines. If I can explain anything&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can. That is the old Shelby division?&#8221;
inquired the official, his finger point resting on a
line on the chart running due southeast between
the Mountain Division and the South Branch out
of Rockton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; assented the foreman proudly.
&#8220;You know it has been practically abandoned
except for coal freight, since the south line was
completed. It&#8217;s used as a belt line now&mdash;transfer
at Shelby Junction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Risky. We sent a freight over this morning.
It got through four hours late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it got through, you say?&#8221; spoke the official
earnestly. &#8220;Get the dispatcher again. Ask for
details on that division. Don&#8217;t lose any time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The foreman was busy at the &#8217;phone for some
minutes. As he held the receiver suspended in his
hand, he reported to the railroad president:</p>
<p>&#8220;Snow and drifting wind reported between
here and Dunwood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out for washouts and culverts and
bridges damaged by running ice and water
between Dunwood and Kingston.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s half the forty-five miles&mdash;go head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Between Kingston and Shelby Junction water
out over the bottoms and flood coming down the
valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s on the schedule?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All schedules cancelled, not a wheel running
except on instructions from this end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give them,&#8221; spoke the official sharply. &#8220;Tell
the dispatcher to keep the line clear from end to
end. Wire to the stations that a special is coming
through, no stops.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; assented the foreman in wonderment,
and executed the order. The official stood
by his side until he had completed the message.
Then he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell the dispatcher to get Clay City, and find
out if the Midland Express over the Midland Central
left on time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On time, sir, and their road is not much hampered,&#8221;
reported the foreman a few minutes later.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; nodded the official briskly. &#8220;Now
then, get out your best locomotive. Give her a
shallow caboose, and get her ready as speedily as
you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>The foreman ran out into the roundhouse. The
president took out his watch. To the infinite surprise
of Ralph he called out:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This way, Fairbanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>He placed a hand on the shoulder of the young
engineer and looked him earnestly in the eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you and your record,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is
that your regular fireman?&#8221; indicating Fogg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, Lemuel Fogg. We&#8217;re on No.&nbsp;999,
Overland Express.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I know,&#8221; spoke Mr. Grant hurriedly.
&#8220;Mr. Fogg!&#8221;</p>
<p>The fireman approached promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends,&#8221; continued the official rapidly to
both. &#8220;I have got to reach Shelby station by
10.15. I must catch the Night Express on the
Midland Central at that point&mdash;without fail,&#8221;
added Mr. Grant with emphasis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; nodded Fogg coolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;One minute late means the loss of a great big
fortune to the Great Northern. The minute on
time means anything in reason you two may ask,
if you make the run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are here to make the run, Mr. Grant, if
you say so,&#8221; observed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; supplemented Fogg, taking off his coat.
&#8220;Is that the order, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the heart to order any man on a run
a night like this,&#8221; responded the official, &#8220;but if
you mean it&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks,&#8221; shot out the fireman, all fire and
energy, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get&nbsp;999 ready for your orders,&#8221; and
he was out into the roundhouse after the foreman
in a flash.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Grant, you&#8217;re taking a long chance,&#8221; suggested
the division superintendent, coming up to
where the president and Ralph stood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and it must be any chances, Fairbanks,&#8221;
said the official. He was becoming more and more
excited each succeeding minute. &#8220;I&#8217;m too old a
railroader not to know what the run means. If
you start, no flinching. It&#8217;s life or death to the
Mountain Division, what you do this night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Mountain Division?&#8221; repeated Ralph,
mystified.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s an official secret, but I trusted you
once. I can trust you now.&#8221; Mr. Grant drew a
folded paper from his pocket. &#8220;The president of
the Midland Central is on the Night Express,
returning from the west. The document I show
you must be signed before he reaches the city,
before midnight, or we lose the right to run over
the Mountain Division. If he once reaches the
city, interests adverse to the Great Northern will
influence him to repudiate the contract, which
only awaits his signature to make it valid. He
will sign it if I can intercept him. Can you make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
Shelby Junction, ninety miles away, in two hours
and fifteen minutes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will make Shelby Junction ahead of the
Night Express,&#8221; replied Ralph calmly, but with
his heart beating like a triphammer, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll go
down with&nbsp;999.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>A RACE AGAINST TIME</h3>
</div>
<p>There was a thrill and fervor to the present
situation that appealed to Ralph mightily. The
brisk, animated procedure of the president of the
Great Northern had been one of excitement and
interest, and at its climax the young engineer
found himself stirred up strongly.</p>
<p>Mr. Grant smiled slightly at Ralph&#8217;s valiant
declaration. He drew the division superintendent
aside in confidential discourse, and Ralph went
to the bulletin board and began studying the routeing
of the Shelby division. Then he hurried out
into the roundhouse.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;999 was steamed up quickly. Ralph put the
cab in rapid order for a hard run. The foreman
hurried back to his office and telephoned to the
yards. When No.&nbsp;999 ran out on the turntable
it was the foreman himself who opened the ponderous
outside doors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s some weather,&#8221; observed Fogg, as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
giant locomotive swung out into the heart of a
driving tempest.</p>
<p>The foreman directed their movements to a
track where a plug engine had just backed in with
a light caboose car. There was no air brake
attachment and the coupling was done quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All ready,&#8221; reported Ralph, as Mr. Grant came
up with the division superintendent.</p>
<p>The railroad president stepped to the platform
of the caboose, spoke a few words to his recent
companion in parting, and waved his hand signal-like
for the start.</p>
<p>Fogg had been over the Shelby division several
times, only once, however, on duty. He knew its
&#8220;bad spots,&#8221; and he tried to tell his engineer about
them as they steamed off the main track.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just three stations the whole stretch,&#8221;
he reported, &#8220;and the tracks are clear&mdash;that&#8217;s one
good point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is only obstruction and breakdowns we
have to look out for,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;Give us
plenty of steam, Mr. Fogg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s heaps of fuel&mdash;a good six tons,&#8221; spoke
the fireman. &#8220;My! but the stack pulls like a blast
furnace.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cab curtains were closely fastened. It was
a terrible night. The snow came in sheets like
birdshot, a half-sleet that stung like hail as it cut
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
the face. The rails were crusted with ice and the
sounds and shocks at curves and splits were ominous.
At times when they breasted the wind full
front it seemed as if a tornado was tugging at the
forlorn messenger of the night, to blow the little
train from the rails.</p>
<p>Fogg stoked the fire continuously, giving a
superabundant power that made the exhaust pop
off in a deafening hiss. They ran the first ten
miles in twelve minutes and a half. Then as they
rounded to the first station on the run, they were
surprised to receive the stop signal.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bad,&#8221; muttered the fireman, as they
slowed down. &#8220;Orders were for no stops, so this
must mean some kind of trouble ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; spoke Mr. Grant sharply,
appearing on the platform from the lighted
caboose. He held his watch in his hand, and his
pale face showed his anxiety and how he was evidently
counting the minutes.</p>
<p>An operator ran out from the station and
handed a tissue sheet to Ralph. The latter read
it by the light of the cab lantern. Mr. Grant
stepped down from the platform of the caboose.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Fairbanks?&#8221; he asked somewhat
impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a great jam at the dam near Westbrook,&#8221;
reported Ralph. &#8220;Driftwood has crossed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
the tracks near there, and the operator beyond
says it will be a blockade if the dam breaks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you willing to risk it?&#8221; inquired the
official.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we are here for,&#8221; asserted Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting worse and worse!&#8221; exclaimed
Fogg, after a half-hour&#8217;s further running.</p>
<p>Ralph never forgot that vital hour in his young
railroad experience. They were facing peril, they
were grazing death, and both knew it. The wind
was a hurricane. The snow came in great sheets
that at times enveloped them in a whirling cloud.
The wheels crunched and slid, and the pilot threw
up ice and snow in a regular cascade.</p>
<p>There was a sickening slew to the great locomotive
as they neared Westbrook. The track
dropped here to take the bridge grade, and as they
struck the trestle Fogg uttered a sharp yell and
peered ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t stop now!&#8221; he shouted; &#8220;put on
every pound of steam, Fairbanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph was cool and collected. He gripped the
lever, his nerves set like iron, but an awed look
came into his eyes as they swept the expanse that
the valley opened up.</p>
<p>The trestle was fully half a foot under water
already, and the volume was increasing every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
moment. Fogg piled on the coal, which seemed to
burn like tinder. Twice a great jar sent him
sprawling back among the coal of the tender. The
shocks were caused by great cakes of ice or stray
timbers shooting down stream with the gathering
flood, and sliding the rails.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s broke!&#8221; he panted in a hushed, hoarse
whisper, as they caught sight of the dam. There
was a hole in its center, and through this came
pouring a vast towering mass fully fifteen feet
high, crashing down on the bridge side of the obstruction,
shooting mammoth bergs of ice into the
air. As the sides of the dam gave way, they were
fairly half-way over the trestle. It seemed that
the roaring, swooping mass would overtake them
before they could clear the bridge.</p>
<p>The light caboose was swinging after its groaning
pilot like the tail of a kite. A whiplash sway
and quiver caused Ralph to turn his head.</p>
<p>The door of the caboose was open, and the light
streaming from within showed the railroad president
clinging to the platform railing, swaying
from side to side. He evidently realized the peril
of the moment, and stood ready to jump if a crash
came.</p>
<p>A sudden shock sent the fireman reeling back,
and Ralph was nearly thrown from his seat. The
locomotive was bumping over a floating piece of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
timber of unusual size, and toppling dangerously.
Then there came a snap. The monster engine
made a leap as if freed from some incubus.</p>
<p>&#8220;The caboose!&#8221; screamed Fogg, and Ralph felt
a shudder cross his frame. He could only risk a
flashing glance backward&mdash;the caboose was gone!
It had broken couplings, and had made a dive
down through the flood rack clear to the bottom
of the river, out of sight. Then No.&nbsp;999 struck
the edge of the up grade in safety, past the danger
line, gliding along on clear tracks now.</p>
<p>Fogg stood panting for breath, clinging to his
seat, a wild horror in his eyes. Ralph uttered a
groan. His hand gripped to pull to stop, a sharp
shout thrilled through every nerve a message of
gladness and joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you&mdash;we&#8217;ve made it!&#8221;</p>
<p>The railroad president came sliding down the
diminished coal heap at the rear of the tender.
He had grasped its rear end, and had climbed over
it just as the caboose went hurtling to destruction.
The glad delight and relief in the eyes of the
young engineer revealed to the official fully his
loyal friendship. Fogg, catching sight of him,
helped him to his feet with a wild hurrah. The
fireman&#8217;s face shone with new life as he swung to
his work at the coal heap.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If we can only make it&mdash;oh, we&#8217;ve got to make
it now!&#8221; he shouted at Ralph.</p>
<p>There was a sharp run of nearly an hour. It
was along the lee side of a series of cuts, and the
snow was mainly massed on the opposite set of
rails. Ralph glanced at the clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re ahead of calculations,&#8221; he spoke to
Fogg.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in for another struggle, though,&#8221;
announced the fireman. &#8220;When we strike the lowlands
just beyond Lisle, we&#8217;ll catch it harder than
ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph was reeking with perspiration, his eyes
cinder-filled and glazed with the strain of continually
watching ahead. There had not been a single
minute of relief from duty all the way from
Westbrook. They struck the lowlands. It was a
ten-mile run. First it was a great snowdrift, then
a dive across a trembling culvert. At one point
the water and slush pounded up clear across the
floor of the cab and nearly put out the fire. As
No.&nbsp;999 rounded to higher grade, a tree half
blown down from the top of an embankment
grazed the locomotive, smashing the headlight and
cutting off half the smokestack clean as a knife
stroke.</p>
<p>Ralph made no stop for either inspection or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
repairs. A few minutes later an incident occurred
which made the occasion fairly bristle with new
animation and excitement.</p>
<p>Mr. Grant had sat quietly in the fireman&#8217;s seat.
Now he leaned over towards Ralph, pointing
eagerly through the side window.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Ralph above the deafening roar
of the wind and the grinding wheels, &#8220;the Night
Express.&#8221;</p>
<p>They could see the lights of the train ever and
anon across an open space where, about a mile distant,
the tracks of the Midland Central paralleled
those of the Shelby division of the Great Northern.
The young engineer again glanced at the
clock. His eye brightened, into his face came the
most extravagant soul of hope. It was dashed
somewhat as Fogg, feeding the furnace and closing
the door, leaned towards him with the words:</p>
<p>&#8220;The last shovel full.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean it!&#8221; exclaimed Ralph.</p>
<p>The fireman swept his hand towards the empty
tender.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight miles,&#8221; said Ralph in an anxious tone.
&#8220;With full steam we could have reached the Junction
ten minutes ahead of the Express. Will the
fire last out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll mend it some,&#8221; declared the fireman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
&#8220;Fairbanks, we might lighten the load,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The tender.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;cut it loose,&#8221; and a minute
later the railroad president uttered a sudden cry
as the tender shot into the distance, uncoupled.
Then he understood, and smiled excitedly. And
then, as Fogg reached under his seat, pulled out a
great bundle of waste and two oil cans, and flung
them into the furnace, he realized the desperate
straits at which they had arrived and their forlorn
plight.</p>
<p>Conserving every ounce of steam, all of his
nerves on edge, the young engineer drove No.&nbsp;999
forward like some trained steed. As they rounded
a hill just outside of Shelby Junction, they could
see the Night Express steaming down its tracks,
one mile away.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve made it!&#8221; declared Ralph, as they came
within whistling distance of the tower at the interlocking
rails where the two lines crossed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; yelled Fogg suddenly, &#8220;they&#8217;ve given the
Express the right of way.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was true. Out flashed the stop signal for
No.&nbsp;999, and the white gave the &#8220;come on&#8221; to
the Night Express. There was no time to get to
the tower and try to influence the towerman to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
cancel system at the behest of a railroad president.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must stop that train!&#8221; rang out the tones
of the official sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to,&#8221; replied Fairbanks grimly.</p>
<p>He never eased up on No.&nbsp;999. Past the tower
she slid. Then a glowing let up, and then, disregarding
the lowered gates, she crashed straight
through them, reducing them to kindling wood.</p>
<p>Squarely across the tracks of the incoming train
the giant engine, battered, ice-coated, the semblance
of a brave wreck, was halted. There she
stood, a barrier to the oncoming Express.</p>
<p>Ralph jumped from his seat, reached under it,
pulled out a whole bunch of red fuses, lit them,
and leaning out from the cab flared them towards
the oncoming train, Roman-candle fashion.</p>
<p>The astonished towerman quickly changed the
semaphore signals. Her nose almost touching No.&nbsp;999,
the Express locomotive panted down to a
halt.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall hear from me, my men,&#8221; spoke the
railroad president simply, but with a great quiver
in his voice, as he leaped from the cab, ran to the
first car of the halted express and climbed to its
platform.</p>
<p>Ralph drove No.&nbsp;999 across the switches. The
Express started on its way again. In what was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
the proudest moment of his young life, the loyal
engineer of staunch, faithful No.&nbsp;999 saw the
president of the Great Northern take off his hat
and wave it towards himself and Fogg, as if with
an enthusiastic cheer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>ZEPH DALLAS AGAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Say&mdash;Engineer Ralph&mdash;Mr. Fairbanks!&#8221;</p>
<p>A spluttering, breathless voice halted Ralph on
his way from the depot to the roundhouse. It was
the call boy, Torchy, the young engineer ascertained,
as he waited till the excited juvenile came
up to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble, Torchy?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>Torchy caught his breath, but the excited flare
in his eyes did not diminish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; he spluttered out; &#8220;I was looking for
you. That car, the one they use out west in Calfrancisco,
Francifornia, no, I mean Calfris&mdash;rot!
out west, anyway&mdash;tourist car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, yes,&#8221; nodded Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you remember the queer old fossil&#8217;s special
to Fordham spur? That fellow Zeph Dallas
was on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember distinctly; go ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another car just like that one in the
yards now, right this minute.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so? I didn&#8217;t suppose that more
than one antiquated relic of that kind was in existence,&#8221;
said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on and see,&#8221; invited Torchy. &#8220;This last
car must have come from the north this morning,
just like the other one did. It&#8217;s bunched up with
a lot more of the blockade runners, delayed
freight, you know, and they&#8217;ve made up a train
of it and others for the Mountain Division.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides being intensely interested, Ralph had
time to spare. It was nearly a week after the
Shelby Junction incident. The great storm had
crippled some of the lines of the great Northern
to a fairly alarming extent. The Mountain Division
had felt the full force of the blizzard and
had suffered the most extensively. There were
parts of the division where it took several days to
repair culverts, strengthen trestles and replace
weakened patches of track. The Overland
Express missed several runs, but had got back on
fair schedule two days before. A new storm had
set in that very morning, and as Ralph followed
Torchy there were places where the drifts were
up to their knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are,&#8221; announced his companion,
pausing and pointing over at a train on a siding.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that last car the very picture of the one
that Dallas was on?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Remarkably so,&#8221; assented Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get to the roundhouse,&#8221; explained
the little fellow, turning back in his tracks.
&#8220;Thought you&#8217;d want to know about that car,
though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, most emphatically,&#8221; declared Ralph, &#8220;and
greatly obliged to you for thinking of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph approached the train on the siding. It
was one of the queerest he had ever seen. There
was a motley gathering of every class of freight
cars on the line. As he passed along he noted the
destination of some of the cars. No two were
marked for the same point of delivery. It was
easy to surmise that they were victims of the
recent blockade.</p>
<p>Ralph came up to the rear car of the incongruous
train with a good deal of curiosity. It was
not the car that had made that mysterious run to
Fordham Spur with Zeph Dallas, although it
looked exactly like it. The present car was newer
and more staunch. A fresh discovery made Ralph
think hard. The car was classified as &#8220;fast
freight,&#8221; and across one end was chalked its presumable
destination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fordham Spur,&#8221; read the young engineer.
&#8220;Queer&mdash;the same as the other car. I wonder
what&#8217;s aboard?&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like the other car, the curtains were closely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
drawn in this one. There was no sign of life
about the present car, however. Smoke curled
from a pipe coming up through its roof. No one
was visible in the immediate vicinity except a flagman
and some loiterers about a near switch shanty.
Ralph stepped to the rear platform of the car. He
placed his hand on the door knob, turned it, and
to his surprise and satisfaction the door opened
unresistingly.</p>
<p>He stepped inside, to find himself in a queer situation.
Ralph stood in the rear partitioned-off
end of the car. It resembled a homelike kitchen.
An oil stove stood on a stand, and around two
sides of the car were shelves full of canisters,
boxes and cans, a goodly array of convenient eatables.
Lying asleep across a bench was a young
colored man, who wore the cap and apron of a
dining-car cook.</p>
<p>Ralph felt that he was intruding, but his curiosity
overcame him. He stepped to the door of
the partition. Near its top was a small pane of
glass, and through this Ralph peered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare!&#8221; he exclaimed under his breath, and
with a great start.</p>
<p>A strange, vivid picture greeted the astonished
vision of the young railroader. If the rear part of
the tourist car had suggested a modern kitchen,
the front portion was a well-appointed living
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
room. It had a stove in its center, and surrounding
this were all the comforts of a home. There
was a bed, several couches, easy chairs, two illuminated
lamps suspended from side brackets, and
the floor was covered with soft, heavy rugs.</p>
<p>Upon one of the couches lay a second colored
man, apparently a special car porter, and he, like
the cook, was fast asleep. All that Ralph had so
far seen, however, was nothing to what greeted
his sight as his eyes rested on the extreme front
of the car.</p>
<p>There, lying back in a great luxurious armchair,
was a preternaturally thin and sallow-faced man.
His pose and appearance suggested the invalid or
the convalescent. He lay as if half dozing, and
from his lips ran a heavy tube, connected with a
great glass tank at his side.</p>
<p>Such a picture the mystified Ralph had never
seen before. He could not take in its full meaning
all in a minute. His puzzled mind went groping
for some reasonable solution of the enigma.
Before he could think things out, however, there
was a sound at the rear door of the car. Some
one on the platform outside had turned the knob
and held the door about an inch ajar, and Ralph
glided towards it. Through the crack he could
see three persons plainly. Ralph viewed them
with wonderment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>He had half anticipated running across Zeph
Dallas somewhere about the train, but never this
trio&mdash;Ike Slump, Jim Evans and the man he had
known as Lord Montague. The two latter were
standing in the snow. Ike was on the platform.
He was asking a question of the man who had
posed as a member of the English nobility:</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quick, Morris; what am I to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lord Montague, <i>alias</i> Morris, with a keen
glance about him, drew a heavy coupling pin from
under his coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it,&#8221; he said hastily, &#8220;and get inside that
car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose there&#8217;s somebody hinders me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you they were all asleep?&#8221;
demanded Morris. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find a man near a big
glass tank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; demurred Ike; &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to get
into any more trouble. When it comes to striking
a man with that murderous weapon&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Murderous fiddlesticks!&#8221; interrupted Morris.
&#8220;You are to hurt nobody. Smash the tank, that&#8217;s
all&mdash;run out, join us, and it&#8217;s a hundred dollars
cash on the spot, and a thousand when I get my
fortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here goes, then,&#8221; announced Ike Slump, pushing
open the door, &#8220;but what you want to go to all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
this risk and trouble for to smash an old glass
tank, I can&#8217;t imagine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll know later,&#8221; muttered Morris grimly.</p>
<p>Ralph did not know what the three rascals were
up to, but he realized that it must be something
bad. Putting two and two together, thinking
back a bit of all that had occurred concerning
Zeph, the Clark boy, and the Slump crowd, he
began to fancy that tourist cars played a big part
in the programme, whatever that programme was.
The smashing of the glass tank, Morris had
announced, was worth a hundred dollars to Ike&mdash;might
lead to a fortune, he had intimated.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some wicked plot afoot,&#8221; decided
Ralph, &#8220;so&mdash;back you go, Ike Slump!&#8221;</p>
<p>As Ike stepped across the threshold of the car
the young engineer acted. He had grabbed the
coupling pin from Ike&#8217;s hand, dropped it, grasped
Ike next with both hands and pressed him backwards
to the platform. Ike struggled and himself
got a grip on Ralph. The latter kept forcing
his opponent backwards. Ike slipped and went
through the break in the platform railing where
the guard chain was unset, and both toppled to the
ground submerged in three feet of snow.</p>
<p>Ralph had landed on top of Ike and he held him
down, but the cries of his adversary had brought
Evans and Morris to his rescue. The former was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
pouncing down upon Ralph with vicious design
in his evil face, when a new actor appeared on the
scene.</p>
<p>It was Zeph Dallas. He came running to the
spot with his arms full of packages, apparently
some supplies for the tourist car which he had just
purchased of some store on Railroad Street.
These he dropped and his hand went to his coat
pocket. The amateur detective was quite as practical
and businesslike as did he appear heroic, as
he drew out a weapon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave that fellow alone, stand still, or you&#8217;re
goners, both of you,&#8221; panted Zeph. &#8220;Hi! hello!
stop those men! They&#8217;re conspirers, they&#8217;re
villains!&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeph&#8217;s fierce shouts rang out like clarion notes.
They attracted the attention of the crowd around
the switch shanty, and as Evans and Morris
started on a run three or four of the railroad
loiterers started to check their flight. As Zeph
helped Ralph yank Ike Slump to his feet and drag
him along, the young engineer observed that
Evans and Morris were in the custody of the
switch shanty crowd.</p>
<p>Two men coming down the track hastened over
to the crowd. Ralph was glad to recognize them
as Bob Adair, the road detective, and one of the
yards watchmen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble here, Fairbanks?&#8221; inquired
Adair, with whom the young engineer was a prime
favorite and an old-time friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dallas will tell you,&#8221; intimated Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; burst out Zeph excitedly; &#8220;I want these
three fellows arrested, Mr. Adair. They must be
locked up safe and sound, or they&#8217;ll do great
harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;Evans? Slump?&#8221; observed Adair, recognizing
the twain who had caused the Great Northern
a great deal of trouble in the past. &#8220;They&#8217;ll
do on general principles. Who&#8217;s this other
fellow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the worst of the lot, the leader. He&#8217;s an
awful criminal,&#8221; declared Zeph with bolting eyes
and intense earnestness. &#8220;Mr. Adair, if you let
that crowd go free, you&#8217;ll do an awful wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s the charge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Conspiracy. They&#8217;re trying to&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, come up to the police station and give
me something tangible to go on, and I&#8217;ll see that
they get what&#8217;s coming to them,&#8221; promised the
road detective.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t&mdash;say, see! my train. I&#8217;ve got to go
with that train, Ralph,&#8221; cried Zeph in frantic agitation.
&#8220;Try and explain, don&#8217;t let those fellows
get loose for a few hours&mdash;vast fortune&mdash;Marvin
Clark&mdash;Fred Porter&mdash;Fordham Cut&mdash;big plot!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>In a whirl of incoherency, Zeph dashed down
the tracks, for the train with the tourist car had
started up. He had just time enough to gather up
his scattered bundles and reach the platform of the
last car, as the mixed train moved out on the main
line and out of sight, leaving his astonished auditors
in a vast maze of mystery.</p>

<p>&#8220;A snowslide!&#8221; exclaimed Ralph, in dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;An avalanche!&#8221; declared Fogg. &#8220;Dodge&mdash;something&#8217;s
coming!&#8221;</p>
<p>With a crash both cab windows were splintered
to fragments. The young engineer of No.&nbsp;999
was nearly swept from his seat as there poured in
through the gap a volume of snow.</p>
<p>They had struck an immense snowdrift
obliquely, but the fireman&#8217;s side caught the brunt.
As the powerful locomotive dove into the drift,
the snow packed through the denuded window-frame
at the fireman&#8217;s seat like grain into a bin.
A solid block of snow was formed under the terrific
pressure of the compact. It lodged against
the coal of the tender with a power that would
probably have crushed the life out of a person
standing in the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; shouted Fogg. &#8220;Lucky I ducked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph stopped the engine, which had been going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
slower and slower each minute of the past hour.
They had gotten about half the distance to Rockton.
Long since, however, both engineer and fireman
had fully decided that they would never make
terminus that night.</p>
<p>They had left Stanley Junction under difficulties.
The snow was deep and heavy, and there
was a further fall as they cleared the limits. There
was no wind, but the snow came down with blinding
steadiness and volume, and at Vernon they
got the stop signal.</p>
<p>The operator stated that the line ahead leading
past Fordham Cut was impassable. The passenger
was stalled ten miles away, and orders from
Rockton were to the effect that the Overland
Express should take the cut-off. This diverged
into the foothills, where there were no such deep
cuts as on the direct route, and where it was hoped
the drifts would not be so heavy.</p>
<p>Neither Ralph nor Fogg was familiar with their
new routing. For an hour they made fair progress.
Then they began to encounter trouble.
They did not run a yard that the pilot wheels were
not sunk to the rims in snow. Landmarks were
blotted out. As they found themselves blindly
trusting to the power of the giant locomotive to
forge ahead despite obstacles, they were practically
a lost train.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>It was now, as they dove bodily into a great
drift choking up an embankment cut, that they
realized that they had reached a definite angle in
their experience of the run, and were halted for
good.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;999 barely pushed her nose far enough out
of the enveloping drift, to enable Ralph by the
aid of the glaring headlight to discern other drifts
further ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re stalled, that&#8217;s dead sure,&#8221; declared
Fogg. &#8220;Signal the conductor and see what the
programme is.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was some time after the tooting signal that
the conductor put in an appearance. He did not
come along the side track. That was fairly impossible,
for it would have been sheer burrow progress.
He came over the top of the next car to the
tender, a blind baggage, and as he climbed over
the coal in the tender his lantern smashed and he
presented a pale and anxious face to the view of
the cab crew.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the prospects?&#8221; he inquired in a discouraged
tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like an all-night lay-over,&#8221; reported
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing ahead, of course,&#8221; said the
conductor calculatingly. &#8220;There&#8217;s a freight due
on the in track. Behind us a freight was to come,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
provided No. 11 put out from Stanley Junction
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which I doubt,&#8221; said Fogg.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could back to Vernon we&#8217;d be in better
touch with something civilized,&#8221; went on the
conductor. &#8220;The wires are all down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can try it,&#8221; replied Ralph, &#8220;but without a
pilot the rear car will soon come to a bump.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give her a show, anyway,&#8221; suggested the
conductor.</p>
<p>Two minutes&#8217; effort resulted in a dead stop.
The young engineer knew his business well enough
to understand that they were in danger of running
the train off the track.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send a signal back, if a man can get back,&#8221;
decided the conductor.</p>
<p>The backing-up had left a clear brief space
before the train. Ralph took a lantern and left his
fireman in charge of the locomotive. He was
gone about ten minutes, and came back panting
and loaded down with the heavy, clinging snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;May as well bunk in right here,&#8221; ventured
Fogg.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; answered Ralph definitely. &#8220;It&#8217;s
drift after drift ahead. No use disabling the locomotive,
and we simply can&#8217;t hope to dig our way
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conductor came forward again looking miserable.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
A red lantern had been planted as far
down the tracks as the brakeman dared to go.
The conductor and Ralph held a conversation.
Fogg, a veteran in the service, was appealed to
for a final decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve hit it,&#8221; said the fireman sagely and
with emphasis. &#8220;It&#8217;s a permanent blockage, and
our only chance is for the Great Northern to find
us out or for us to wait until the snow melts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If this snow keeps up we&#8217;ll be buried under,&#8221;
said the conductor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve got to make the best of it,&#8221;
advised Fogg. &#8220;If we can make it, build a big
fire ahead there as a warning or signal, although
I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s much stirring at either end.
Then it&#8217;s just a question of food and warmth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Food!&#8221; repeated the conductor, who was fat
and hearty and looked as if he never willingly
missed his meals; &#8220;where in the world are we to
get food? They cut the diner off at the Junction,
and there probably isn&#8217;t a farmhouse or station
along this dreary waste for miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I fancy we&#8217;ll have to stand the hunger,&#8221;
said Ralph. &#8220;As to the heat, that&#8217;s an essential
we mustn&#8217;t neglect. We had better shut off the
steam pipes, keeping only a little fire in the furnace
and starting the stoves in the coaches.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we might last out on that plan,&#8221; nodded
the conductor, glancing over the tender.</p>
<p>Ralph pulled to a spot about two hundred feet
ahead, where the advance and retreat of the train
had cleared a space alongside the rails, and the
conductor went back to the coaches.</p>
<p>Ralph adjusted the steam pipes so they would
not freeze, and Fogg banked the fire. Then they
got to the ground with rake and shovel, and skirmished
around to see what investigation might
develop.</p>
<p>Despite the terrible weather and the insecurity
of their situation, the train crew were soon cheerily
gathering wood up beyond the embankment.
They had to dig deep for old logs, and they broke
down tree branches. Then they cleared a space
at the side of the track and started a great roaring
fire that flared high and far.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody will run into that,&#8221; observed Fogg
with a satisfied chuckle.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it may lead a rescue party,&#8221; suggested
Ralph.</p>
<p>Some of the men passengers strolled up to the
fire. Fear and anxiety had given way to a sense
of the novelty of the situation. Ralph assured
them that their comfort and safety would be
looked after. He promised a foraging party at
daylight in search of food supplies.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re talking about you back there in the
coaches, Fairbanks,&#8221; reported the conductor a
little later. &#8220;They know about your arrangements
for their comfort, and they&#8217;re chatting and
laughing, and taking it all in like a regular picnic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ve been giving me undue credit,
you modest old hero!&#8221; laughed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; suddenly exclaimed Fogg; &#8220;now,
what is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>All hands stared far to the west. A dim red
flame lit the sky. Then it appeared in a new spot,
still far away. This was duplicated until there
were vague red pencils of light piercing the sky
from various points of the compass.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s queer,&#8221; commented the conductor.
&#8220;Something&#8217;s in action, but what, and how?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; exclaimed Fogg, as suddenly seemingly
just beyond the heavy drift immediately in
front of the train the same glare was seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and here, too!&#8221; shouted out the conductor,
jumping back.</p>
<p>Almost at his feet something dropped from
midair like a rocket, a bomb. It instantly burst
out in a vivid red flame. Ralph investigated, and
while thus engaged two more of the colored messengers,
projectiles, fireworks, whatever they
were, rained down, one about half-way down the
train, the other beyond it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>The young engineer was puzzled at first, but he
soon made out all that theory and logic could
suggest. There was no doubt but that some one
at a distance had fired the queer little spheres,
which were made of the same material as the regular
train fuse, only these burned twice as long
as those used as railroad signals, or fully twenty
minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I make it out,&#8221; explained Ralph to the conductor,
&#8220;that somebody with a new-fangled device
like a Roman candle is sending out these bombs as
signals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;re not alone in our misery,&#8221;
remarked Fogg.</p>
<p>&#8220;First they went west, then they came this
way,&#8221; continued Ralph. &#8220;I should say that it
looks as if the signal is on a train stalled like us
about a mile away. I&#8217;ll soon know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph got into the cab. In a minute or two No.&nbsp;999
began a series of challenge whistles that
echoed far and wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; ordered Fogg, as they waited for a
reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;A mere peep,&#8221; reported the conductor, as a
faint whistle reached their strained hearing above
the noise of the tempest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Fogg, &#8220;I figure it out. There&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
a train somewhere near with the locomotive nigh
dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it should be the east freight stalled,&#8221; suggested
Ralph to the conductor, &#8220;you needn&#8217;t
worry about those hungry children in the coaches,
and that baby you told about wanting milk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the east freight is a regular provision
train,&#8221; put in the fireman. &#8220;If we could reach
her, we&#8217;d have our pick of eatables.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was two hours later, and things had quieted
down about the snowed-in train, when a series of
shouts greeted Ralph, Fogg and the conductor,
seated on a broken log around the fire at the side
of the tracks.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this new windfall!&#8221; exclaimed Fogg.</p>
<p>&#8220;More signals,&#8221; echoed the conductor, staring
vaguely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Human signals, then,&#8221; supplemented Ralph.
&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s a queer arrival.&#8221;</p>
<p>Five persons came toppling down the side of the
embankment, in a string. They were tied together
at intervals along a rope. All in a mix-up, they
landed helter-skelter in the snow of the cut. They
resembled Alpine tourists, arrived on a landslide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Burton, fireman of the east freight!&#8221;
shouted the conductor, recognizing the first of the
five who picked himself up from the snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s who!&#8221; answered the man addressed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
panting hard. &#8220;We&#8217;re stalled about a mile down
the cut. Coal given out, no steam. Saw your fire,
didn&#8217;t want to freeze to death quite, so&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We guessed that you were the Overland,&#8221;
piped in a fresh, boyish voice. &#8220;Packed up some
eatables, and here we are. How do you like my
new railroad rocket signals, Engineer Fairbanks?&#8221;
and Archie Graham, the young inventor,
picked himself up from the snow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>
<p>One hour after daybreak the vicinity of the
snowbound Overland Express resembled a picture,
rather than a forlorn blockade.</p>
<p>The lone adventurers who had made the trip
from the stalled freight had been a relief party
indeed. The engineer was a railroader of long
experience, and he had thought out the dilemma
of the refugees. He and his companions had
broken open a freight car and had brought each a
good load. There was coffee, sugar, crackers,
canned meats, a ham, and, what was most welcome
to anxious mothers and their babes, a whole
crate of condensed milk.</p>
<p>There never was a more jolly breakfast than
that aboard the snowbound coaches. There was
plenty to eat and to spare all around, and plenty
more at the stalled freight, everybody knew. In
front of the engine many a merry jest went the
rounds, as the train crews and some of the passengers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
broiled pieces of succulent ham on the
end of pointed twigs.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, it was this way,&#8221; Archie Graham
explained to the young engineer of No.&nbsp;999. &#8220;I
was just watching a chance for washouts or snowstorms
to get on a train diving into the danger.
Those red bombs are my invention. I shoot them
from a gun. I can send them a mile or gauge
them to go fifty feet. They ignite when they drop,
and by sending out a lot of them they are bound
to land somewhere near the train you aim at.
The engineer is bound to take notice, just as you
did, of the glare, and that&#8217;s where they beat the
fusees and save the running back of a brakeman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Archie,&#8221; said Ralph honestly, &#8220;I believe you&#8217;re
going to hit some real invention some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I helped out some with my patent rocket signals
this time,&#8221; declared Archie.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did, my lad,&#8221; observed Fogg with enthusiasm,
&#8220;and the passengers know all about it, and
they&#8217;ve mentioned you in a letter they&#8217;re getting
up to the company saying how they appreciate
the intelligence&mdash;that&#8217;s Fairbanks&mdash;the courage,
ahem! that&#8217;s me, and the good-heartedness, that&#8217;s
all of us, of the two train crews.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the middle of the afternoon a snow plow
opened up the line from Rockton to the stalled
train. It was not until two mornings later,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
however, that the main line was open and Ralph and
Fogg got back to Stanley Junction.</p>
<p>Archie came on the same train. Ralph asked
him up to the house, but the young inventor said
he wanted the quiet of his hotel room to work on
his signal rocket idea, which he declared would
amount to something yet.</p>
<p>The young engineer had scarcely got in the
house after the warm, cheerful greeting of his
anxious mother, when Zeph Dallas put in an
appearance.</p>
<p>Zeph was looking exceedingly prosperous. He
wore a new, nicely-fitting suit of clothes, a modest
watch and chain, and was quite dignified and subdued,
for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;ve had your breakfast, Ralph,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got something to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Ralph, &#8220;I&#8217;m expecting to hear
a pretty long story from you, Zeph.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young engineer hurried his breakfast and
soon joined Zeph in the sitting-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Ralph,&#8221; at once observed his friend,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve done some big things in your time, but
the biggest thing you ever did was when you saw
to it that Jim Evans and Ike Slump, and most
of all, that fellow, Morris, were held as prisoners
by Adair, the road detective.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I fancied they deserved locking up,&#8221; remarked
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;There would have been a murder if you hadn&#8217;t
seen to it,&#8221; declared Zeph. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a story to tell
that would make your hair stand on end, but it
would take a book to tell it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here to listen, Zeph,&#8221; intimated Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I&#8217;m due to meet Mr. Adair at the jail.
He&#8217;s sent Evans and Slump back to the prison
they escaped from. I hurried on here from the
Fordham cut purposely to tell him what I wanted
done with Morris.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Zeph,&#8221; rallied the young railroader,
&#8220;you seem to have a big say in such things for a
small boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; declared Zeph good-naturedly;
&#8220;I&#8217;m all here, just the same, and I&#8217;m
here for a big purpose. In a word, not to mystify
you, Ralph, for you know only half of the story,
I was hired by Marvin Clark, the son of the Middletown
&amp; Western Railroad president, to do all
I&#8217;ve done, and I have been royally paid for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must have done something effective,&#8221;
observed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clark thought so, anyway. I&#8217;ll try and be
brief and to the point, so that you&#8217;ll understand
in a nutshell. You know Marvin Clark and Fred
Porter and the two Canaries?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>The young engineer nodded assentingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as I say, I ran across Clark accidentally
in my stray wanderings. He and a sickly boy
named Ernest Gregg were living in a fixed-over
building at Fordham Spur. I seemed to be just
the person Clark was waiting for. He hired me
to do some work for him. He was planning to get
the poor boy, Gregg, his rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know about that,&#8221; observed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if you do, I can hurry over things. It
seems that when he began to look up Gregg&#8217;s
affairs, he found out that Ernest had a strange
hermit of a grandfather, named Abijah Gregg.
Ernest&#8217;s father was an only son. About five years
ago the old man discovered a terrible forgery in
which he was robbed of over ten thousand dollars.
He had reason to believe that Ernest&#8217;s
father and a man named Howard were responsible
for it. He disowned his son and all his family,
and a month later Ernest&#8217;s father died, leaving his
son a disowned and homeless outcast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what became of Howard?&#8221; inquired the
interested Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;He disappeared. Old Gregg became soured at
all humanity after that,&#8221; narrated Zeph; &#8220;the
more so because he had a profligate nephew who
turned out bad. This was the man in jail here
now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Lionel Montague&mdash;Morris?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Morris robbed the old man, who became
afraid of him. The old man tried to hide away
from everybody. In his wanderings he picked
up the two Canaries and settled down at the lonely
place at Fordham Cut. He was very rich, partly
paralyzed, and intended to leave his fortune to the
state, rather than have any relative benefit by it.
Well, Marvin Clark, the splendid, unselfish fellow,
got a clew to all this. He located old Abijah
Gregg. He spent just loads of money following
down points, until he discovered that the man
Howard was a broken-down invalid in New Mexico.
Clark was sick himself for a month, and
that was why Fred Porter did not hear from
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And later?&#8221; asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ran across Porter and brought him to the
Spur about a month ago. He is there now. Well,
Clark found out positively that Ernest&#8217;s father
never had a thing to do with forgery. It had
been really committed by Howard and this villain,
Morris. He got in touch with Howard in
New Mexico, who was a dying man. He found
him anxious to make what reparation he could for
a wicked deed. Old Gregg would not go to New
Mexico. Howard could only live where the air
was just right for him. The physicians said that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
if he ever went to any other climate, the change
of atmosphere would kill him. With plenty of
money at his command, Clark arranged it all. The
New Mexico doctors got a tank that held an artificial
air, and Clark arranged so that Howard
could come east in a special car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the first tourist car that you ran empty to
the Spur?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we knew that Morris was trying every
way to locate and annoy his uncle. We thought
that maybe he had got onto our plans about Howard.
We ran the dummy car to see if we were
being watched. Don&#8217;t you see, that if Morris had
succeeded in smashing the glass air tank, Howard
would have died before he could tell his story to
old Mr. Gregg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now?&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;The story has been told. Old Mr. Gregg is
convinced that his son was innocent of forgery.
He will take care of his grandson and make him
his heir, and young Clark, as you see, has done a
grand thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; assented Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howard will return to New Mexico with a
relieved conscience. I am going to the jail here
now to see Morris. If he will agree to leave the
country and never annoy his uncle again, I will
give him a certain large sum of money, as directed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
by his uncle. If he doesn&#8217;t, he will be prosecuted
for the forgery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Zeph,&#8221; observed the young railroader enthusiastically,
&#8220;you have proven yourself not only a
real detective, but a splendid lawyer, as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; returned Zeph, and blushed modestly;
&#8220;most everybody that gets in with you does
some kind of good in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was two hours later when a messenger came
to the Fairbanks home with a letter for Ralph.</p>
<p>The young engineer flushed with pleasure as he
read a brief communication from the master
mechanic, advising him that Mr. Robert Grant,
president of the Great Northern, was at Stanley
Junction, and wished to see him for a few minutes
at the Waverly Hotel.</p>
<p>Ralph told his mother of the incident, and her
eyes followed him fondly and proudly as, arrayed
in his best, Ralph started out to keep his
appointment.</p>
<p>It was a warm welcome that the young railroader
received from the great railroad magnate.
Mr. Grant went over their mutual experiences the
night of the wild dash of the special from Rockton
to Shelby Junction.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did a most important service for the road
that night, Fairbanks,&#8221; said the railroad president;
&#8220;how much, is a secret in the archives of the company,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
but I can say to you confidentially that the
Mountain Division would have passed to another
line if we had not acted in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad,&#8221; said Ralph modestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to acknowledge that service. I am only
the president of the road,&#8221; said Mr. Grant, smiling,
and Ralph smiled, too, &#8220;so being a servant of
the road, I must act under orders. I learned that,
like all thrifty young men, you had a savings
account at the bank here. I have deposited there
the company&#8217;s check for one thousand dollars to
your account.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Grant&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; began Ralph, but the railroad
president held up his hand to check the
interruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;As to Fogg,&#8221; went on Mr. Grant, &#8220;the road
has closed up the subscription in his behalf, by
giving him sufficient to rebuild his burned-down
house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph&#8217;s face was aglow with pride, pleasure
and happiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, good-by for the present, Fairbanks,&#8221; concluded
the railroad president, grasping Ralph&#8217;s
hand warmly. &#8220;There are higher places for ambitious
young men in the service of the road, as you
know. I shall not try to influence your plans,
for I know that sheer merit will put you forward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
when you decide to advance. As to my personal
influence, that, you know, is yours to command.
For the present, however, we should regret to see
the Overland Express in other hands than those
of the youngest and the best engineer on the Great
Northern.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Mr. Grant had to say about Ralph&#8217;s
advancement came true a little later, and those
who care to follow our hero&#8217;s future career may
do so in the next story of this series, to be called,
&#8220;Ralph, the Train Dispatcher; or, The Mystery
of the Pay Car.&#8221; In that volume we shall meet
many of our old friends once more, and see what
our hero did when new difficulties confronted
him.</p>
<p>One day Ralph was surprised to receive a visit
from Marvin Clark and Fred Porter. He
received them both warmly, and soon learned that
Clark had fixed up his trouble over railroad work,
and with his parent, and had secured a good position
for Fred, so that the latter would no longer
need to lead a roving life.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I must have one more ride with you, Fairbanks,&#8221;
said Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll go along,&#8221; said the son of the railroad
president.</p>
<p>&#8220;With pleasure!&#8221; cried Ralph. &#8220;Come on!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
And he led the way to where No.&nbsp;999 stood ready
for the next run.</p>
<p>The trip was a grand success. And here we
will, for the present, at least, say good-by to
Ralph of the Overland Express.</p>
